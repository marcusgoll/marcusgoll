## Problem

Most task management apps are overcomplicated with features most users don't need - teams, integrations, reporting. Sometimes you just need a fast, private list that works offline.

## Solution

A local-first task tracker using IndexedDB for browser storage. No accounts, no servers, no sync complexity. Tasks support markdown, tags, and priority levels. Export to JSON for backup or switching devices.

## Results

Personal productivity tool demonstrating local-first architecture principles. Used daily for managing development tasks and project planning. Open-sourced as example of minimal viable product (MVP) approach.
