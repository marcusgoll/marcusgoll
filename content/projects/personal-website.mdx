## Problem

Building a personal brand that bridges two distinct domains - aviation and software development - requires a platform that can showcase both without dilution. Traditional portfolio sites force creators to choose one identity, but my audience spans pilots learning to code and developers interested in aviation's systematic thinking principles.

## Solution

A dual-track content platform that uses category-based filtering, structured data for SEO, and content design principles to serve both audiences. The site demonstrates the technical skills I teach while applying aviation's checklist methodology to development workflows.

## Tech Stack

Modern JAMstack architecture optimized for performance and SEO:
- **Next.js 16** with App Router for server-side rendering and static generation
- **TypeScript** for type safety across 15,000+ lines of code
- **MDX** for rich content with embedded React components
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom design tokens for brand consistency
- **Schema.org JSON-LD** for enhanced search engine visibility
- **Vercel Edge Functions** for serverless contact form processing
- **Google Analytics 4** for conversion tracking

## Challenges & Lessons

**Dual-Track Content Strategy**: Balancing aviation and dev content without fragmenting the brand. Solution: Unified voice around "systematic thinking" with clear category badges (Aviation/Development/Cross-pollination).

**SEO for Niche Audiences**: Ranking for both "flight instructor tips" and "TypeScript tutorials". Solution: Comprehensive Schema.org implementation (BlogPosting, Person, Organization, FAQPage schemas) with category-specific optimization.

**Performance on Mobile**: Aviation audience often browses on phones between flights. Solution: Achieved 95+ Lighthouse scores across all metrics with image optimization, code splitting, and edge caching.

## Results & Impact

- **5,000+ monthly visitors** with 60% organic search traffic
- **50+ blog posts** published across aviation and development topics
- **3x increase** in consulting inquiries since launch
- **95+ Lighthouse scores** across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO
- **Featured content** appearing in Google rich results (featured snippets, FAQ boxes)

The site itself is a teaching tool - every technical decision is documented in blog posts, demonstrating the thinking process behind modern web development.
