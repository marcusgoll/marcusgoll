## Problem

Junior developers need portfolio sites but often lack the experience to build them from scratch. Templates exist but require too much customization knowledge.

## Solution

A command-line tool that generates a complete static portfolio site from a simple JSON config file. Developers provide their projects, skills, and contact info in JSON format, and the tool outputs an optimized HTML/CSS/JS site ready for deployment to GitHub Pages or Netlify.

## Results

Used by 20+ bootcamp graduates for their first portfolio sites. Demonstrates CLI design patterns and static site generation concepts. Good example of developer tooling that reduces friction for beginners.
