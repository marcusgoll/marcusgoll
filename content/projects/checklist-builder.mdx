## Problem

Aviation uses checklists religiously for safety, but most industries lack structured checklist tools. Software developers could benefit from deployment checklists, but building custom tools takes time away from core work.

## Solution

A universal checklist builder that lets anyone create, customize, and share checklists. Templates for common scenarios (aircraft pre-flight, software deployment, incident response) with ability to create custom lists. Checklists can be printed, exported as JSON, or run interactively in the web app.

## Results

Demonstrates cross-pollination of aviation safety culture into other domains. Used personally for deployment checklists and code review procedures. Showcases Vue.js 3 Composition API and Pinia state management patterns.
