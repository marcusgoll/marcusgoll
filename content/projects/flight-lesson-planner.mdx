## Problem

Flight instructors need a quick way to sequence lessons according to FAA requirements without complex scheduling software. Many use spreadsheets or paper, which don't provide templates or progression tracking.

## Solution

A lightweight React app that provides pre-built lesson templates for Private, Instrument, and Commercial training. Instructors can customize sequences, track student progress, and export lesson plans as PDFs. All data stored locally for privacy.

## Results

Used by 50+ independent CFIs who prefer simplicity over feature-heavy platforms. Particularly popular for freelance instructors who don't need full school management systems.
