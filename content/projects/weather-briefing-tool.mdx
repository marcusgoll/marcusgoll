## Problem

Pilots need to check multiple sources for weather briefings - METAR for current conditions, TAF for forecasts, NOTAMs for airspace restrictions. The official FAA briefing system is functional but not mobile-friendly.

## Solution

A mobile-first web app that aggregates aviation weather data from official sources into a single view. Pilots enter their departure and destination airports, and the app fetches all relevant weather information with color-coded alerts for significant conditions (low ceilings, strong winds, icing).

## Results

Personal tool used for 100+ flights over 2 years. Demonstrates FastAPI backend integration with aviation data sources and responsive frontend design.
