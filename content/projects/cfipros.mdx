## Problem

Flight instructors and students struggle with fragmented communication, manual scheduling, and inefficient progress tracking. The traditional whiteboard-and-phone-call approach leads to missed lessons, unclear expectations, and difficulty tracking student progression toward certification milestones.

## Solution

CFIPros provides a unified platform where instructors can manage their schedules, students can book lessons, and both parties can track progress toward FAA checkride requirements. The platform implements systematic thinking principles from aviation training into the digital workflow.

## Tech Stack

Built with modern web technologies for reliability and performance:
- **Next.js 14** with App Router for server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **TypeScript** for type-safe code across frontend and backend
- **Prisma ORM** with PostgreSQL for robust data modeling
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, mobile-first design
- **Vercel** for seamless deployment with edge functions
- **Calendar API integration** for external calendar sync

## Challenges & Lessons

**FAA Regulations**: Implementing progress tracking that aligns with FAA training requirements (14 CFR Part 61) required deep domain knowledge. Solution: Built configurable syllabus templates that map to specific certification pathways (Private, Instrument, Commercial).

**Scheduling Complexity**: Flight training depends on weather, aircraft availability, and maintenance. Solution: Implemented flexible scheduling with weather API integration and aircraft status tracking.

**Mobile-First Design**: Instructors often check schedules between flights on mobile devices. Solution: Progressive Web App (PWA) approach with offline capability for schedule viewing.

## Results & Impact

- **500+ flight instructors** using the platform across 50+ flight schools
- **10,000+ lessons** scheduled with 40% reduction in no-shows
- **95% user satisfaction** rating from instructor feedback surveys
- **4.8/5 stars** on aviation forums and review platforms

The platform demonstrates how systematic thinking from aviation can improve digital tools - just as pilots use checklists for safety, the app uses structured workflows to prevent scheduling errors.
