# Welcome to Our MDX-Powered Blog

We're excited to announce that our blog has migrated from Ghost CMS to **MDX** (Markdown + JSX), bringing new capabilities and better developer experience.

## What is MDX?

MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. This allows us to:

- Write content in familiar Markdown syntax
- Embed interactive React components
- Version control our content with Git
- Eliminate external CMS dependencies

## New Features

### 1. Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks now have beautiful syntax highlighting powered by rehype-highlight:

```typescript
// TypeScript example with automatic highlighting
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  date: string;
  tags: string[];
}

const post: BlogPost = {
  title: "Welcome to MDX Blog",
  slug: "welcome-to-mdx",
  date: "2025-10-21",
  tags: ["announcements", "dev", "mdx"],
};
```

### 2. Interactive Components

We can now embed interactive React components directly in our content:

<Callout type="info" title="Try it out!">
  This is a Callout component embedded in MDX. It supports different types: info, warning, error, and success.
</Callout>

### 3. GitHub Flavored Markdown

Full support for tables, task lists, and more:

| Feature | Ghost CMS | MDX |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Version Control | ❌ | ✅ |
| React Components | ❌ | ✅ |
| Build-time Validation | ❌ | ✅ |
| Zero External Deps | ❌ | ✅ |

Task list example:
- [x] Migrate from Ghost to MDX
- [x] Setup content directory
- [x] Create sample posts
- [ ] Import historical posts

### 4. Optimized Images

Images are automatically optimized using Next.js Image component for better performance.

## What's Next?

We're excited about the possibilities MDX brings. Expect more interactive content, better performance, and richer experiences.

Stay tuned for more updates!

<Callout type="success">
  Migration complete! All future posts will be written in MDX format.
</Callout>
