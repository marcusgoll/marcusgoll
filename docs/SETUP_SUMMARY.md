## Troubleshooting

### If agents aren't working as expected

1. **Verify agent brief exists**: Check `.claude/agents/[agent-name].md`
2. **Check constitution reference**: Ensure `.spec-flow/memory/setup-constitution.md` exists
3. **Review brand guidelines**: Some agents need brand voice info from `brand-guidelines.md`
4. **Provide context**: Give agents clear, specific instructions with target audience and goals

### If quality is inconsistent

1. **Use templates**: Always reference templates (e.g., blog-post-template.md)
2. **Run checklists**: Use the quality checklists in templates
3. **Provide examples**: Share examples of desired output quality
4. **Iterate**: Ask agents to review and improve based on checklist

### If agents conflict

1. **Clarify roles**: Each agent has specific responsibilities (see constitution)
2. **Follow workflow**: Agents should hand off work in sequence
3. **Use Brand Strategist**: For conflicts, consult Brand Strategist for direction

---

## Constitution Governance

The constitution (`.spec-flow/memory/setup-constitution.md`) is the single source of truth for all project decisions.
