## üåä Competitive Positioning (Blue Ocean Strategy)

**Category**: "Systematic Cross-Domain Thinking"
- Not just aviation educator (red ocean)
- Not just dev educator (red ocean)
- Creating new category: Applying systematic frameworks across domains (blue ocean)

**Unique Market Position:**
- Only airline pilot + 10-year educator + developer teaching cross-domain frameworks
- No direct competitors occupy this exact space
- Differentiated by credentials (teacher + pilot + dev), not just content style

**White Space**:
- Aviation educators don't teach developers
- Dev educators don't apply aviation principles
- Multi-passionate creators don't emphasize systematic thinking
- **You bridge all three** = uncontested market space
