I'm making a shift in how I show up here.

For the past [X] years, I've been balancing three worlds:
‚Üí Flying as an airline pilot at PSA Airlines
‚Üí Teaching (10 years high school science + 2 years as a CFI)
‚Üí Building tech on the side (currently CFIPros.com)

Most people told me to pick one. I'm choosing all three.

Here's what I'll be sharing:

‚úàÔ∏è Aviation content: Flight training tips, CFI teaching strategies, and the path from student pilot to airline pilot

üíª Dev/startup content: Building CFIPros.com publicly, systematic development practices, and how I code while flying 80 hours/month

üéì Cross-pollination: How aviation's systematic thinking makes you a better developer (and vice versa)

If you're interested in any of these‚Äîor you're someone who refuses to fit in one box‚Äîlet's connect.

What are you building while working your "main" job?
```

6. **Pinned Tweet** - Intro thread:
   ```
   Thread (1/7):
   I'm an airline pilot who builds startups on the side.

   Here's how I balance flying 80 hours/month while building CFIPros.com:

   üßµ

   ---

   (2/7) First: Aviation taught me systematic thinking.

   Every flight has a checklist. Every procedure has a reason.

   I apply the same discipline to development.

   No winging it. No hoping it works.

   Test ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Monitor.

   ---

   (3/7) Second: Time blocking is non-negotiable.

   As a pilot, my schedule is set weeks in advance.

   I know exactly when I'm flying and when I'm free.

   I treat dev time the same: blocked calendar, protected hours, no exceptions.

   ---

   (4/7) Third: Small wins compound.

   Can't code for 8 hours straight? Fine.

   I do 2-hour sprints between trips.

   30 minutes before a flight.

   1 hour after landing.

   It adds up to 15-20 hours/week.

   ---

   (5/7) What I'm building: CFIPros.com

   A directory connecting aspiring pilots with quality flight instructors.

   Combining my aviation expertise with my dev skills.

   Tech stack: React, Node.js, deployed on Vercel.

   ---

   (6/7) What I'll share here:

   ‚Üí Weekly #BuildInPublic updates
   ‚Üí Dev tutorials with systematic thinking
   ‚Üí Aviation career guidance
   ‚Üí How to build while working full-time

   ---

   (7/7) If this resonates, follow along.

   I'm just getting started, but I'm committed to sharing the entire journey.

   The wins, the fails, the late-night debugging sessions.

   Let's build together. üöÄ
   ```

- **Batch create**: Write 5-10 posts in one sitting, schedule over 2 weeks
- **Repurpose**: One blog post ‚Üí LinkedIn post ‚Üí Twitter thread ‚Üí Newsletter

### Time Management
