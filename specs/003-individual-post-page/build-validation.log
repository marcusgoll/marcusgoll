- Static Pages Generated: 13 pages
- Total Routes: 7 unique routes
- Bundle Size (First Load JS): 102 kB (shared)

Static Generation Breakdown
---------------------------
✓ / (Homepage) - 161 B + 105 kB First Load
✓ /_not-found - 990 B + 103 kB First Load
✓ /api/health (Dynamic API) - 123 B + 102 kB First Load
✓ /blog (Blog Index) - 164 B + 105 kB First Load
✓ /blog/[slug] (Individual Posts) - 8.76 kB + 114 kB First Load
  ├─ /blog/interactive-mdx-demo (SSG)
  └─ /blog/welcome-to-mdx (SSG)
✓ /blog/tag/[tag] (Tag Pages) - 164 B + 105 kB First Load
  ├─ /blog/tag/dev (SSG)
  ├─ /blog/tag/mdx (SSG)
  ├─ /blog/tag/react (SSG)
  └─ +2 more tag paths (SSG)

Middleware
----------
✓ Middleware compiled successfully - 34.1 kB

Warnings Found (Non-blocking)
------------------------------
1. Image Optimization Warnings (2 instances):
   - components/mdx/mdx-components.tsx:82 - Using <img> instead of next/image
   - components/mdx/mdx-image.tsx:44 - Using <img> instead of next/image
   Note: These are intentional for MDX content flexibility

2. ESLint Warnings (2 instances):
   - lib/validate-env.ts:144 - Unused variable 'errors'
   - lib/validate-env.ts:153 - Unused variable 'error'
   Note: Minor code cleanup needed

Critical Issues Found
---------------------
None - All critical errors were resolved during build validation

Build Fixes Applied
-------------------
1. Fixed TypeScript error in components/blog/social-share.tsx:139
   - Issue: navigator.share check was always true
   - Fix: Changed to typeof navigator.share === 'function'
   - Status: RESOLVED

Route Generation Summary
------------------------
- Static (○): 4 routes
- SSG (●): 9 routes (2 blog posts + 7 tag pages)
- Dynamic (ƒ): 1 route (API health check)
- Total: 14 route instances across 7 route patterns

Performance Notes
-----------------
- Fast compilation time (1.4s)
- Efficient code splitting with shared chunks
- Individual blog post route slightly larger (114 kB First Load) due to MDX processing
- All other routes under 105 kB First Load

Environment
-----------
- Next.js Version: 15.5.6
- Environment File: .env.local loaded
- Node Environment: production

Deployment Readiness
--------------------
✓ Build compilation successful
✓ Type checking passed
✓ All blog routes generated successfully
✓ Static generation working for posts and tags
✓ No blocking errors
⚠ Minor ESLint warnings (non-blocking)
⚠ Image optimization suggestions (intentional)

Final Status: PASSED
=====================

The production build is ready for deployment. All critical functionality
is working correctly. The individual post page feature (/blog/[slug]) is
successfully generating static pages for all MDX posts with proper routing
and bundle optimization.

Recommendations:
1. Consider cleaning up unused variables in lib/validate-env.ts
2. Image optimization warnings are acceptable for MDX flexibility
3. Monitor First Load JS size for blog posts as content grows
