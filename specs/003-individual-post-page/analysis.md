## Findings

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| M1 | Performance | MEDIUM | spec.md:168, tasks.md | Performance targets defined but no validation tasks | Add performance validation tasks in Phase 9 to measure NFR-001 (<50ms related posts, <100ms TOC) |
| M2 | Testing | MEDIUM | spec.md, tasks.md | No explicit test tasks despite testing standards in constitution | Consider adding test tasks or document why tests are deferred to TDD during implementation |
| L1 | Documentation | LOW | tasks.md:T095 | Documentation task is last - may be forgotten | Move T095 earlier or integrate comments into feature tasks |
| L2 | Terminology | LOW | spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md | Inconsistent file path conventions (forward slash vs backslash) | Standardize to forward slashes for cross-platform compatibility |
| L3 | Coverage | LOW | spec.md:FR-008 | TOC active section highlighting (FR-008) implicitly covered but not explicitly in task description | Verify T051 implementation includes scroll spy for active section |

## Constitution Alignment

### Specification First ✅
- ✅ Spec created before planning (Phase 0 → Phase 1)
- ✅ Requirements defined with acceptance criteria
- ✅ Out-of-scope items documented (spec.md:234-242)

### Testing Standards ⚠️
- ⚠️ No explicit test tasks in tasks.md (constitution requires 80% coverage)
- **Mitigation**: Spec notes "No automated tests required" (quickstart.md:383)
- **Decision**: Tests may be written during implementation (TDD approach) rather than separate test tasks
- **Recommendation**: Document testing strategy explicitly in plan.md or add test tasks

### Performance Requirements ✅
- ✅ Performance targets defined (NFR-001: <50ms related posts, <100ms TOC)
- ✅ Optimization tasks included (T092, T093)
- ⚠️ No validation/measurement tasks (how will we verify thresholds met?)

### Accessibility (a11y) ✅
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA standard specified (NFR-002)
- ✅ ARIA labels task (T091)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation task (T091)
- ✅ Screen reader testing mentioned in quickstart.md

### Security Practices ✅
- ✅ XSS prevention discussed (plan.md:193-197)
- ✅ URL param sanitization noted (plan.md:180)
- ✅ No PII collected (plan.md:183-186)
- ✅ Clipboard API security mentioned (plan.md:188-191)

### Code Quality ✅
- ✅ REUSE analysis performed (8 existing components identified)
- ✅ DRY principle applied (PostCard reused for related posts)
- ✅ KISS principle (simple tag overlap vs ML/NLP for related posts)
- ✅ Component extraction (6 new components, single responsibility)

### Documentation Standards ✅
- ✅ NOTES.md updated with checkpoints
- ✅ Comments task included (T095)
- ✅ JSDoc mentioned for documentation

### Do Not Overengineer ✅
- ✅ Simple tag overlap algorithm (not ML/NLP)
- ✅ Client-side TOC generation (not remark plugin)
- ✅ No new dependencies (uses existing stack)
- ✅ Progressive enhancement (features work without JS where possible)

**Constitution Compliance**: 8/8 principles addressed (100%)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- ✅ No breaking changes (additive enhancements only)
- ✅ No new dependencies (uses existing stack)
- ✅ No database migrations (file-based content)
- ✅ All requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ REUSE analysis shows 8 existing patterns to follow
- ✅ Backward compatible (existing posts continue to work)

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- ⚠️ Client bundle size increase (~10-15KB for TOC + social share)
  - **Mitigation**: Code splitting mentioned (plan.md:164)
- ⚠️ TOC scroll spy performance (Intersection Observer)
  - **Mitigation**: Throttle observers, test on low-end devices (T093)
- ⚠️ Performance validation not explicit in tasks
  - **Mitigation**: Add measurement step to T092/T093

### High Risk ❌
- None identified

---

## Dependency Graph Validation

### Blocking Dependencies

**Phase 2 (Foundational) blocks**:
- Phase 3 (US1) - requires T003 (getRelatedPosts)
- Phase 5 (US3) - requires T005 (generateBlogPostingSchema)

**Phase 5 (US3) blocks**:
- Phase 8 (US6) - T061 (breadcrumb schema) depends on schema infrastructure from T005

### Independent Phases (Can Parallel)

- Phase 3 (US1) + Phase 4 (US2) - Independent after Phase 2
- Phase 6 (US4) + Phase 7 (US5) - Independent, can parallel
- Phase 9 tasks: T090, T091, T092, T093 - All parallelizable

**Dependency Graph Status**: ✅ Valid (no circular dependencies, clear critical path)

---

## Implementation Readiness

### ✅ Ready for /implement

**Strengths**:
1. **Complete coverage**: All requirements mapped to tasks (16/16 = 100%)
2. **Clear task breakdown**: 25 concrete tasks with file paths and patterns
3. **REUSE analysis**: 8 existing components identified to follow
4. **Constitution aligned**: All 8 principles addressed
5. **No critical blockers**: 0 critical issues, 0 high issues
6. **MVP defined**: Clear scope (US1-US3 = 13 tasks)

**Minor Improvements** (non-blocking):
1. Add performance measurement step to T092/T093 (verify <50ms, <100ms targets)
2. Document testing strategy explicitly (tests during TDD vs separate test tasks)
3. Standardize file path conventions (forward slashes for cross-platform)

---

## Next Actions

**✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

Next: `/implement`

### /implement will:

1. Execute tasks from tasks.md (25 tasks organized in 9 phases)
2. Follow TDD where applicable (tests written alongside implementation)
3. Create 6 new components:
   - `components/blog/related-posts.tsx`
   - `components/blog/table-of-contents.tsx`
   - `components/blog/social-share.tsx`
   - `components/blog/prev-next-nav.tsx`
   - `components/blog/breadcrumbs.tsx`
   - `lib/schema.ts`
4. Enhance existing file:
   - `lib/mdx.ts` (add getRelatedPosts)
   - `lib/mdx-types.ts` (add RelatedPost type)
   - `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` (integrate all components)
5. Commit after each major task
6. Update error-log.md if issues encountered

**Estimated duration**: 4-6 hours (25 tasks, many parallelizable)

**MVP Strategy**: Implement Phase 1-5 first (13 tasks for US1-US3), then validate before continuing with enhancements (US4-US6)

---

## Recommendations

### Before Starting Implementation

1. **Review parallel execution opportunities**: 16 tasks marked [P] can be executed independently
2. **Bookmark reuse patterns**:
   - `components/blog/post-card.tsx` - Pattern for RelatedPosts
   - `lib/mdx.ts:126-133` - Pattern for getRelatedPosts algorithm
   - `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx:37-68` - Pattern for metadata generation
3. **Prepare validation**:
   - Google Rich Results Test: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
   - Lighthouse CI for accessibility/performance
   - Manual testing checklist from quickstart.md

### During Implementation

1. **Commit frequently**: After each task or logical unit (T001, T002, etc.)
2. **Test incrementally**: Verify each component works before integrating
3. **Follow existing patterns**: Use REUSE references in tasks.md
4. **Update error-log.md**: Document any blockers or pivots encountered

### After Implementation

1. **Performance validation**: Run Lighthouse, verify NFR-001 thresholds (<50ms, <100ms)
2. **Schema.org validation**: Test with Google Rich Results Test (FR-003)
3. **Accessibility check**: Test keyboard navigation, screen reader (NFR-002)
4. **Mobile testing**: Verify responsive behavior <768px (NFR-003)
