# Specification Quality Checklist: Individual Post Page Enhancements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: specs/003-individual-post-page/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (0 markers - all reasonable defaults provided)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded (Out of Scope section)
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Status**: âœ… All checks passed (16/16)

**Key Decisions**:
1. Feature classified as ENHANCEMENT (builds on feature 002)
2. MVP = US1-US3 (related posts, prev/next nav, schema.org)
3. Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all decisions made with reasonable defaults
4. Assumptions documented (tag-based algorithm, H2/H3 TOC depth, social platforms)
5. Out of scope clearly defined (comments, reactions, PDF export, etc.)

**Validation Notes**:
- Success criteria are measurable (click rates, performance metrics, validation tests)
- All user stories have independent tests
- Effort estimates reasonable (22-30 hours total)
- No deployment dependencies or breaking changes
