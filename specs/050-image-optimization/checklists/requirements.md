# Specification Quality Checklist: Image Optimization (Next.js Image)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: specs/050-image-optimization/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Examples only, not prescriptive
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs - Core Web Vitals, performance, accessibility
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders - User-focused language, measurable outcomes
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed - All template sections filled or marked N/A

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3) - Zero clarification markers
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous - All FR/NFR have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable - LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1, -30% bytes, etc.
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - User-focused outcomes
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined - 4 Given/When/Then scenarios + edge cases
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified - External URLs, missing dimensions, build vs runtime
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded - Out of Scope section documents exclusions
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified - 6 assumptions documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - FR-001 through FR-010 testable
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows - Homepage, blog posts, MDX images, mobile
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - 8 measurable success criteria
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification - Config examples in Context section only

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: All 16 checklist items passed.

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive research captured current state (21 files already using Next.js Image)
- IMPROVEMENT feature correctly identified (not greenfield implementation)
- Measurable success criteria with specific targets (LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1, -30% bytes)
- Clear prioritization (MVP = US1-US3, Enhancement = US4-US5, Nice-to-have = US6)
- Deployment considerations properly marked as low-impact (configuration-only)
- Measurement plan includes specific Lighthouse CI queries

**Ready for `/plan` phase**: No blocking issues. Proceed with implementation planning.
