- NFR-008: Plan leverages Next.js fallback (no task needed)

**Unmapped Tasks**: None - All tasks trace to requirements or essential setup/polish

---

## Ambiguity & Underspecification Check

**Vague Terms Analysis**:
- Spec contains measurable targets: LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1, -30% image bytes
- No vague terms like "fast", "slow", "easy" without metrics
- All NFRs have quantifiable thresholds

**Placeholder Check**:
- No TODO, TBD, or [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in spec
- All external image domains handled on-demand (acceptable strategy)

**Missing Acceptance Criteria**:
- US1-US5: All have explicit acceptance criteria
- US6: Has acceptance criteria (marked as P3 optional, intentionally deferred)

**Underspecified Components**:
- All components referenced in tasks exist in plan.md EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE section
- shimmer.ts utility fully specified in data-model.md (referenced in plan)

**Finding**: No ambiguity or underspecification detected. Spec is implementation-ready.

---

## Duplication & Inconsistency Check

**Requirement Duplication**:
- No duplicate requirements detected
- FR/NFR separation is clear (functional vs non-functional)

**Terminology Consistency**:
- "Next.js Image component" - Consistent across all artifacts
- "blur placeholder" vs "shimmer placeholder" - Both used intentionally (blur = local, shimmer = remote)
- "priority prop" - Consistent usage
- "fill layout" vs "width/height" - Intentional distinction (fill + aspect-ratio is standardization target)

**Component Naming**:
- PostCard, MagazineMasonry, MDXImage - Consistent across spec/plan/tasks
- next.config.ts (not .js) - Consistent (TypeScript project)

**Tech Stack Conflicts**:
- Single framework: Next.js 15.5.6 (no conflicts)
- No competing image optimization libraries

**Finding**: No duplication or inconsistency issues. Terminology is intentionally varied where appropriate.

---

## Dependency & Ordering Validation

**Task Dependencies** (from tasks.md DEPENDENCY GRAPH):
1. Phase 1 (Setup): T001-T003 - Independent
2. Phase 2 (US1): T004-T006 - Blocks US2, US3
3. Phase 3 (US2): T007-T011 - Depends on US1
4. Phase 4 (US3): T012-T015 - Depends on US1, independent from US2
5. Phase 5 (US4): T016-T018 - Depends on US1, US2
6. Phase 6 (US5): T019-T022 - Independent (can run parallel with US4)
7. Phase 7 (Polish): T023-T027 - Depends on all stories

**Dependency Violations**: None detected

**Parallel Execution**:
- 24 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- Examples: T004 [P], T005 [P] (different files), T008 [P], T009 [P], T010 [P] (different components)

**Circular Dependencies**: None

**Finding**: Dependency graph is valid. Parallel opportunities correctly identified.

---

## TDD & Testing Coverage

**TDD Markers**: Not applicable (infrastructure optimization, not TDD feature)

**Testing Strategy** (tasks.md TEST GUARDRAILS):
- Manual performance testing: Lighthouse CI (T023)
- Visual testing: DevTools Network throttling (T011)
- Accessibility testing: Screen reader (T022)
- Regression testing: Before/after screenshots (T018)

**Quality Gates** (spec.md line 199-207):
- LCP <2.5s: T015, T023
- CLS <0.1: T011, T023
- Lighthouse Performance 90: T023
- Lighthouse Accessibility 95: T022
- No build warnings: T006
- All images have alt: T019-T022

**Missing Tests**: None - Testing approach is appropriate for infrastructure optimization

**Finding**: Testing strategy is comprehensive and appropriate for feature type.

---

## Deployment & Rollback Readiness

**Deployment Model**: Detected from constitution.md - staging-prod (Hetzner VPS)

**CI/CD Impact** (plan.md CI/CD IMPACT section):
- Platform: Hetzner VPS + Docker + Caddy (no changes)
- Env vars: None required
- Breaking changes: No (backward compatible)
- Migrations: No database changes

**Smoke Tests** (plan.md DEPLOYMENT ACCEPTANCE):
- Homepage loads with blur placeholders
- Hero image loads immediately (priority)
- Images served as WebP/AVIF
- Lighthouse Performance 90
- No layout shifts (CLS <0.1)

**Rollback Plan**:
- Standard 3-command git revert (T026)
- No database state to rollback
- No environment variables to revert
- Fully reversible (configuration + component changes only)

**Deployment Metadata**: Will be tracked in NOTES.md (T026)

**Finding**: Deployment strategy is well-defined. Rollback is straightforward.

---

## Risk Assessment

**Identified Risks** (from plan.md Risks & Mitigations):

1. External Image Domains Unknown (Medium likelihood)
   - Impact: Unoptimized images if domain not whitelisted
   - Mitigation: Add domains on-demand when warnings appear
   - Status: Acceptable risk with mitigation

2. Sharp Library Installation on VPS (Low likelihood)
   - Impact: Image optimization fails
   - Mitigation: Test Docker build locally
   - Status: Low risk (Next.js handles well)

3. Performance Improvement Lower Than Expected (Low likelihood)
   - Impact: Doesn't meet NFR targets
   - Mitigation: Measure baseline first, iterate
   - Status: Low risk (proven Next.js feature)

4. Breaking Existing Layouts (Medium likelihood)
   - Impact: Layout shifts or incorrect sizing
   - Mitigation: Test each component, compare screenshots
   - Status: Mitigated by T018 (visual regression)

**Unaddressed Risks**: None - All risks have mitigation strategies

**Finding**: Risk management is thorough.

3. Accessibility: 100% alt text → T019-T022 (auditable)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

**PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION**

No blocking issues detected. All artifacts are consistent, complete, and ready for execution.

### Suggested Improvements (Optional)

1. **US6 (Automatic Dimensions)**: Currently marked as P3 optional and not included in tasks. If needed later, create tasks during Phase 3 (enhancement).

2. **Baseline Capture Timing**: T001 creates checklist, but baseline should be captured before T004 changes. Consider adding explicit "capture now" step before US1 implementation.

3. **Parallel Execution Documentation**: Consider adding execution strategy to NOTES.md (which tasks to run in parallel for fastest completion).

### Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before starting `/implement`:
- [ ] Review spec.md one final time (ensure no missed requirements)
- [ ] Capture performance baseline (T001 checklist)
- [ ] Verify Git branch: `feature/050-image-optimization`
- [ ] Ensure Next.js 15.5.6 installed
- [ ] Clear .next cache for clean build

2. **Capture baseline** during T001 before making changes
3. **Follow MVP strategy**: Ship US1-US3 first (Phases 2-4), validate with Lighthouse
4. **Iterate**: Add US4-US5 (Phases 5-6) after MVP validation
5. **Deploy**: Run `/ship` after implementation complete
