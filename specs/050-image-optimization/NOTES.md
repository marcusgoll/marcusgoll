# Feature: Image Optimization (Next.js Image)

## Overview
Implementation of Next.js Image component for optimized image delivery, improving performance through automatic optimization, lazy loading, and responsive image sizing.

## Research Findings

### Current State Analysis
- **Existing Usage**: Next.js Image component is ALREADY used in 21 files across the codebase
- **Components Using Next.js Image**:
  - `PostCard.tsx`: Featured images with fill layout, responsive sizes
  - `MagazineMasonry.tsx`: Hero and masonry grid images with width/height
  - `MDXImage.tsx`: Custom component for MDX images with automatic optimization
  - `Sidebar.tsx`, `FeaturedPostsSection.tsx`: Additional usages

- **Current Implementation Quality**:
  - ✅ Using next/image (not img tags)
  - ✅ Responsive sizes defined
  - ✅ Priority prop on hero images
  - ✅ Aspect ratios preserved
  - ⚠️ External images fall back to img tags (MDXImage.tsx:44-49)
  - ⚠️ Inconsistent sizing patterns across components
  - ⚠️ Missing placeholder configuration

### GitHub Issue #26 Requirements
From issue body:
- ICE Score: 2.50 (HIGH priority)
- Impact: 5/5 (Critical for performance and Core Web Vitals)
- Effort: 2/5 (Straightforward)
- **All implementation checkboxes already marked complete in issue**
- Acceptance criteria defined but NOT checked off
- Target: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1

### Project Context
From constitution.md:
- **Performance Requirements** (lines 550-562):
  - Page loads: <2s First Contentful Paint, <3s Largest Contentful Paint
  - Define thresholds in spec, measure in /optimize phase
  - Use Lighthouse, Web Vitals for validation

- **Accessibility Standards** (lines 565-578):
  - WCAG 2.1 Level AA required
  - Alt text mandatory for all images
  - Semantic HTML required

From package.json:
- Next.js version: 15.5.6 (latest)
- React 19.2.0
- No image-specific dependencies besides Next.js built-in

### Technical Analysis
**What Still Needs to be Done**:
1. **Configuration Optimization**: Add next.config.js image optimization settings
2. **Placeholder Strategy**: Implement blur placeholders consistently
3. **External Image Support**: Configure remotePatterns for external domains
4. **Performance Validation**: Measure and document actual LCP/CLS metrics
5. **Standardization**: Create consistent sizing patterns across components
6. **Alt Text Audit**: Verify all images have descriptive alt text

**Not a Greenfield Implementation**: This is an IMPROVEMENT feature (HAS_OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITY=true)

## System Components Analysis

### Reusable Components
From codebase scan:
- **MDXImage** (`components/mdx/mdx-image.tsx`): Custom wrapper for MDX images
  - Current: Handles local/external images with fallback
  - Improvement needed: External image optimization, consistent placeholders

- **PostCard** (`components/blog/PostCard.tsx`): Blog post card with featured image
  - Current: Uses fill layout with responsive sizes
  - Good pattern to replicate elsewhere

- **MagazineMasonry** (`components/home/MagazineMasonry.tsx`): Magazine-style grid
  - Current: Uses width/height with priority on hero
  - Inconsistent with PostCard's fill approach

### New Components Needed
- None (optimize existing patterns)

### Rationale
System is already using Next.js Image component. This is a refinement and standardization effort, not a new implementation.

## Phase 4: Implementation (2025-10-28)

### Performance Baseline (Before Optimization)

**Metrics to Capture:**
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): TBD
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): TBD
- FCP (First Contentful Paint): TBD
- TTI (Time to Interactive): TBD
- Image bytes transferred: TBD
- Lighthouse Performance Score: TBD

**Baseline Capture Instructions:**
1. Run local dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse
3. Run audit in "Desktop" mode with "Clear storage" checked
4. Record metrics above
5. Run audit in "Mobile" mode (3G throttling)
6. Record metrics above
7. Open Network tab → Filter by "Img" → Reload page
8. Sum total KB transferred for all images

**Status:** Baseline will be captured in /optimize phase (after implementation complete)

### Task Completion Log

#### Batch 1: Setup (T001-T003) - COMPLETED

✅ T001: Create baseline performance capture checklist
- Added Performance Baseline section with metrics template
- Instructions for Lighthouse audit and Network tab analysis
- Will populate actual metrics during /optimize phase

✅ T002: Verify Next.js Image component usage across codebase
- Command: `grep -r "next/image" components/ --include="*.tsx"`
- Found 5 files using Next.js Image component:
  1. components/blog/PostCard.tsx
  2. components/home/FeaturedPostsSection.tsx
  3. components/home/MagazineMasonry.tsx
  4. components/home/Sidebar.tsx
  5. components/mdx/mdx-image.tsx
- Status: Good foundation, all major components already using Next.js Image

✅ T003: Verify no raw img tags exist in components
- Command: `grep -r "<img" components/ --include="*.tsx" | grep -v "next/image"`
- Found 2 occurrences:
  1. components/mdx/mdx-components.tsx: Uses raw img tag (fallback pattern)
  2. components/mdx/mdx-image.tsx: Uses raw img tag for external images (lines 44-49)
- Action: Will remove external image fallback in T009 (MDXImage blur placeholder task)
- Status: Minor cleanup needed, will be addressed in Phase 3

#### Batch 2: Configuration (T004-T005) - COMPLETED

✅ T004: Add image optimization configuration to next.config.ts
- Added formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'] for modern image formats
- Added deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840] for responsive breakpoints
- Added imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384] for smaller UI elements
- Added minimumCacheTTL: 60 seconds for image caching
- Status: Configuration complete, ready for optimization

✅ T005: Add security configuration for images in next.config.ts
- Added dangerouslyAllowSVG: false (blocks XSS risk from SVG uploads)
- Added contentDispositionType: 'attachment' (forces SVG downloads)
- Added remotePatterns: [] (empty array, will add domains on-demand)
- Replaced deprecated domains array with remotePatterns
- Status: Security hardening complete

#### Batch 3: Build Verification (T006) - COMPLETED

✅ T006: Rebuild application and verify image optimization works
- Command: `npm run build`
- Build status: ✅ Compiled successfully in 4.4s
- No "Unoptimized Image" warnings found
- Image warnings found (expected, will fix in next batches):
  - components/mdx/mdx-components.tsx: Using raw img tag
  - components/mdx/mdx-image.tsx: Using raw img tag (external fallback)
- Image cache: `.next/cache/images/` will be created on first image request
- Status: Build successful, ready for blur placeholder implementation

#### Batch 4: Shimmer Utility + Priority Identification (T007, T012) - COMPLETED

✅ T007: Create shimmer placeholder utility in lib/utils/shimmer.ts
- Created: lib/utils/shimmer.ts
- Function: shimmerDataURL(width, height) returns base64-encoded SVG
- Implementation: Animated gradient shimmer effect for blur placeholders
- Usage: Import and use with placeholder="blur" and blurDataURL props
- Status: Utility ready for component integration

✅ T012: Identify above-the-fold images requiring priority prop
- Audited: Homepage components (FeaturedPostsSection, MagazineMasonry)
- Above-the-fold images identified:
  1. FeaturedPostsSection: Both featured post images (up to 2) - ALREADY HAS priority={true} (line 69)
  2. MagazineMasonry hero: Featured hero image - ALREADY HAS priority={true} (line 44)
  3. MagazineMasonry grid: Grid images are below fold - correctly NO priority
- Status: Priority props already correctly implemented, no changes needed
- Decision: T013 and T014 will verify existing implementation (no modifications required)

#### Batch 5: Component Updates (T008-T010, T013-T014) - COMPLETED

✅ T008: Add blur placeholder to PostCard component
- File: components/blog/PostCard.tsx
- Added: import shimmerDataURL from '@/lib/utils/shimmer'
- Added: placeholder="blur" and blurDataURL={shimmerDataURL(800, 450)} to Image
- Result: Blog post cards now show shimmer effect while images load
- Status: Complete

✅ T009: Update MDXImage component to add blur placeholders
- File: components/mdx/mdx-image.tsx
- Added: import shimmerDataURL from '@/lib/utils/shimmer'
- Added: placeholder="blur" and blurDataURL to all three Image branches (local, external, relative)
- REMOVED: Raw img tag for external images (lines 44-49) - now uses Image component
- Result: All MDX images (local and external) now use Next.js Image optimization with blur
- Status: Complete, external images now optimized (requires remotePatterns configuration)

✅ T010: Add blur placeholder to MagazineMasonry hero and grid images
- File: components/home/MagazineMasonry.tsx
- Added: import shimmerDataURL from '@/lib/utils/shimmer'
- Updated hero: placeholder="blur" and blurDataURL={shimmerDataURL(1200, 600)}
- Updated grid: placeholder="blur" and blurDataURL={shimmerDataURL(600, 400)}
- Result: Magazine layout shows shimmer on both hero and grid cards
- Status: Complete

✅ T013: Add priority prop to featured posts in FeaturedPostsSection
- File: components/home/FeaturedPostsSection.tsx
- Verification: priority={true} already present on line 70
- Added: blur placeholder (shimmerDataURL(1280, 720)) for consistency
- Result: Featured posts already have priority, now also have blur placeholders
- Status: Complete (verified + enhanced)

✅ T014: Verify MagazineMasonry hero already has priority prop
- File: components/home/MagazineMasonry.tsx
- Verification: priority={true} confirmed on line 45
