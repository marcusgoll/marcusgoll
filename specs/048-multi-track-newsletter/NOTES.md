# Feature: Multi-track Newsletter Subscription System

## Overview

Implementing a comprehensive newsletter subscription system with granular preference management across four content tracks (Aviation, Dev/Startup, Education, All). System provides GDPR-compliant subscriber management with one-click unsubscribe, secure token-based preference updates, and integration with Resend/Mailgun for email delivery.

## Research Findings

### Project Documentation Analysis

**Tech Stack** (from tech-stack.md):
- Frontend: Next.js 15.5.6 (App Router)
- Backend: Next.js API Routes (integrated serverless)
- Database: PostgreSQL 15+ (self-hosted Supabase)
- ORM: Prisma 6.17.1 (type-safe queries)
- Newsletter: Resend / Mailgun (email delivery)
- Deployment: Hetzner VPS + Docker

**Data Architecture** (from data-architecture.md):
- Existing entities: USER (admin only, placeholder), prepared schemas for NEWSLETTER_SUBSCRIBER and NEWSLETTER_PREFERENCE
- ERD already defined with relationships and constraints
- Schema strategy: Hybrid (MDX files for content, PostgreSQL for subscriber data)
- Multi-project Supabase instance (schema-level isolation)

**API Strategy** (from api-strategy.md):
- API style: REST over HTTPS (Next.js API Routes)
- Base path: `/api/newsletter`
- Newsletter types: 'aviation', 'dev-startup', 'education', 'all'
- Endpoints already defined:
  - POST /api/newsletter/subscribe
  - GET /api/newsletter/preferences/:token
  - PATCH /api/newsletter/preferences
  - DELETE /api/newsletter/unsubscribe
- Rate limiting: 5 req/min per IP (prevent spam)
- Performance targets: P50 <200ms, P95 <500ms
- Authentication: None (public endpoints, token-based for preferences)
- GDPR: Soft delete + hard delete option

### System Components Analysis

**Reusable Components** (from ui-inventory.md):
- Button (variant: default, outline, ghost - with analytics tracking)
- Container (page width constraint)
- Header, Footer (global layout)

**New Components Needed**:
- NewsletterSignupForm (multi-select checkbox group)
- PreferenceManagementPage (full preference editor)
- UnsubscribeConfirmationPage (goodbye message + feedback)

**Email Templates Required**:
- Welcome email (first subscription)
- New post notification (per track)
- Preference update confirmation
- Goodbye email (unsubscribe confirmation)

### Constitution Alignment

**Engineering Principles**:
- âœ… Specification first: This spec defines all requirements upfront
- âœ… Performance: P50 <200ms, P95 <500ms (aligns with <500ms p95 target)
- âœ… Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (keyboard nav, screen reader support)
- âœ… Security: Input validation (Zod), no PII in logs, secure unsubscribe tokens
- âœ… GDPR compliance: Soft delete, hard delete option, right to deletion

**Brand Principles**:
- âœ… Multi-passionate integration: 4 tracks support aviation, dev, education, cross-pollination
- âœ… Systematic clarity: Clear preference management, no confusing opt-in/opt-out patterns
- âœ… Teaching-first: Help text explains each newsletter type clearly

## Feature Classification

- UI screens: true (signup form, preference page, unsubscribe confirmation)
- Improvement: false (new feature, not improving existing flow)
- Measurable: true (target: 100 subscribers in 6 months, track conversion, retention)
- Deployment impact: true (new database tables via migrations, environment variables for email service)

## Checkpoints

- Phase 0 (Specification): 2025-10-28
- Feature directory: specs/048-multi-track-newsletter/
- Branch: feature/048-multi-track-newsletter

## Phase 2: Tasks (2025-10-28 12:30)

**Summary**:
- Total tasks: 34
- User story tasks: 14 (US1-US5 covering MVP scope)
- Parallel opportunities: 14 tasks marked [P]
- Setup tasks: 3
- Foundational tasks: 5
- Polish tasks: 12
- Task file: specs/048-multi-track-newsletter/tasks.md

**Checkpoint**:
- âœ… Tasks generated: 34
- âœ… User story organization: Complete (organized by US1-US5 priority)
- âœ… Dependency graph: Created (Phase 2 foundational blocks all stories)
- âœ… MVP strategy: Defined (US1-US5 complete subscription flow, ~40 hours)
- âœ… Parallel execution: 14 tasks identified for parallel execution
- ðŸ“‹ Ready for: /analyze

**Key Decisions**:
- TDD approach optional (integration tests recommended, E2E for critical paths only)
- Email service abstraction allows switching between Resend/Mailgun
- Token-based preference management eliminates need for login system
- Background email processing ensures <2s API response time
- Soft delete default with hard delete option for GDPR compliance
