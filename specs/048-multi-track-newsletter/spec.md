# Feature Specification: Multi-Track Newsletter Subscription System

**Branch**: `feature/048-multi-track-newsletter`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Story

Visitors to marcusgoll.com want to stay updated on content that matches their interests. Some are pilots interested in aviation content, others are developers following startup/coding topics, and some educators care about teaching methodology. Currently, there's no way to subscribe to content updates, and when a newsletter system is added, users don't want to receive irrelevant content (e.g., aviation enthusiasts getting dev content they don't care about).

The multi-track newsletter system allows visitors to subscribe to one or more content tracks based on their interests, manage their preferences via email links, and unsubscribe easily with one click. The system respects user privacy (GDPR-compliant) and provides granular control over which newsletters they receive.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a visitor lands on the homepage footer, **When** they enter their email and select "Aviation" and "Dev/Startup" newsletters, **Then** they receive a welcome email with links to manage preferences and are added to both newsletter lists.

2. **Given** a subscribed user clicks "Manage preferences" in any newsletter email, **When** they land on the preference page, **Then** they see checkboxes for all 4 newsletter types with their current selections, can update them, and receive confirmation.

3. **Given** a subscribed user clicks "Unsubscribe" in any newsletter email, **When** they confirm unsubscription, **Then** they are removed from all newsletters, see a goodbye message, and receive a final confirmation email with an option to delete their data permanently (GDPR).

4. **Given** a user is subscribed to "All" newsletters, **When** a new post is published in any category, **Then** they receive an email notification regardless of the post's track.

5. **Given** a user is subscribed to "Aviation" only, **When** a new post is published in the "Dev/Startup" category, **Then** they do NOT receive an email notification.

6. **Given** a subscribed user tries to re-subscribe with the same email, **When** they submit the form, **Then** their preferences are updated (upserted) and they receive a confirmation email.

7. **Given** a previously unsubscribed user tries to re-subscribe, **When** they submit the signup form, **Then** their account is reactivated, preferences are updated, and they receive a welcome back email.

8. **Given** a user submits the signup form without selecting any newsletter types, **When** validation runs, **Then** they see an error message "Please select at least one newsletter."

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user enters an invalid email format?
  - Frontend validation shows error before submission
  - Backend Zod schema validates and returns 400 Bad Request with error details

- How does the system handle duplicate emails?
  - Upsert logic updates existing subscriber's preferences instead of creating duplicate
  - Returns success with message "Preferences updated"

- What happens if Resend/Mailgun API is down during signup?
  - Subscriber is saved to database (ensures no data loss)
  - Background retry queue attempts to send welcome email later
  - User sees success message but may receive welcome email delayed

- How does the system prevent unsubscribe token guessing?
  - Token is 64-character hex string (32 random bytes) = 2^256 possible values
  - Cryptographically secure random generation
  - Single-use is not enforced (token remains valid for preference management)

- What happens if a user clicks unsubscribe multiple times?
  - Idempotent operation: returns success even if already unsubscribed
  - Does not send duplicate goodbye emails

- How does the system handle rate limiting abuse?
  - 5 requests per minute per IP address
  - Returns 429 Too Many Requests with retry-after header
  - Legitimate users unlikely to hit limit (normal signup is 1 request)

## Success Metrics (HEART Framework)

> **Purpose**: Define quantified success criteria using Google's HEART framework.
> **Constraint**: All metrics MUST be Claude Code-measurable (SQL, logs, Lighthouse).

| Dimension | Goal | Signal | Metric | Target | Guardrail |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Happiness** | Users find signup easy and clear | Error rate on signup | `SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE outcome='error') / COUNT(*) FROM newsletter_events WHERE event='signup'` | <2% error rate | P95 response <500ms |
| **Engagement** | Users actively manage preferences | Preference updates per subscriber | `SELECT AVG(update_count) FROM (SELECT subscriber_id, COUNT(*) as update_count FROM newsletter_preferences GROUP BY subscriber_id)` | 0.3+ updates/subscriber (30% adjust preferences) | <10% unsubscribe rate |
| **Adoption** | Convert homepage visitors to subscribers | Signup conversion rate | `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT subscriber_id) FROM newsletter_subscribers WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'` | 100 subscribers in 6 months (currently 0) | <$5 cost per subscriber (if paid ads used) |
| **Retention** | Subscribers stay active over time | 30-day retention rate | `SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE active=true) / COUNT(*) FROM newsletter_subscribers WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'` | 85% remain active after 30 days | <15% churn/month |
| **Task Success** | Users complete signup without abandonment | Signup completion rate | `SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE outcome='completed') / COUNT(*) FROM newsletter_events WHERE event='signup_started'` | 80% complete signup | <30s P95 completion time |

**Performance Targets** (from `design/systems/budgets.md`):
- FCP <1.5s, TTI <3.5s, CLS <0.15, LCP <3.0s
- Lighthouse Performance â‰¥85, Accessibility â‰¥95

See `.spec-flow/templates/heart-metrics-template.md` for full measurement plan.

## Screens Inventory (UI Features Only)

> **Purpose**: Define screens for `/design-variations` workflow (Phase 1).

Screens to design:
1. **newsletter-signup-form**: Newsletter subscription form - Primary action: "Subscribe"
2. **preference-management**: Edit newsletter preferences - Primary action: "Update Preferences"
3. **unsubscribe-confirmation**: Unsubscribe confirmation and feedback - Primary action: "Delete My Data"

States per screen: `default`, `loading`, `empty`, `error`, `success`

See `.spec-flow/templates/screens-yaml-template.yaml` for full screen definitions.

## Context Strategy & Signal Design

- **System prompt altitude**: Mid-level (API implementation + form validation + email templates)
- **Tool surface**: Prisma (database), Zod (validation), Resend/Mailgun SDK (email)
- **Examples in scope**:
  1. Multi-checkbox form validation (at least 1 required)
  2. Token-based authentication for preference management
  3. Idempotent unsubscribe (handle duplicate clicks)
- **Context budget**: 50k tokens (specification phase)
- **Retrieval strategy**: JIT - fetch project docs (data-architecture.md, api-strategy.md) during planning
- **Memory artifacts**: NOTES.md updated after each phase, newsletter-metrics.md for analytics
- **Compaction cadence**: Summarize research after specification, compact implementation logs after deploy
- **Sub-agents**: None (integrated implementation)

## Deployment Considerations

> **Purpose**: Document deployment constraints and dependencies for planning phase.

### Platform Dependencies

**Next.js (Hetzner VPS + Docker)**:
- New API routes: `/api/newsletter/subscribe`, `/api/newsletter/preferences/:token`, `/api/newsletter/preferences`, `/api/newsletter/unsubscribe`
- Dockerfile unchanged (no new system dependencies)
- Docker Compose: No changes

**Dependencies**:
- New: `resend` or `@sendgrid/mail` (email delivery library)

- `NEWSLETTER_FROM_NAME`: Sender name (e.g., "Marcus Gollahon")
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: Base URL for preference/unsubscribe links (e.g., "https://marcusgoll.com")

**Schema Update Required**: Yes - Update `lib/env-schema.ts` to validate new variables

### Breaking Changes

**API Contract Changes**: No (new endpoints, no existing API to break)

**Database Schema Changes**:
- Yes: New tables `newsletter_subscribers` and `newsletter_preferences`
- Migration required: Create tables with constraints and indexes
- No breaking changes to existing schema

**Auth Flow Modifications**: No (public endpoints, no authentication)

**Client Compatibility**: Backward compatible (new feature, no existing functionality modified)

### Migration Requirements

**Database Migrations**:
- Yes: Create `newsletter_subscribers` table with columns (id, email, active, subscribed_at, unsubscribed_at, unsubscribe_token, source)
- Yes: Create `newsletter_preferences` table with columns (id, subscriber_id, newsletter_type, subscribed, updated_at)
- Yes: Add indexes (email, unsubscribe_token, active, subscriber_id, newsletter_type)
- Yes: Add constraints (UNIQUE email, UNIQUE token, UNIQUE(subscriber_id, newsletter_type), CHECK newsletter_type ENUM)

**Data Backfill**: Not required (new feature, no existing data)

**RLS Policy Changes**: No (not using Row-Level Security)

**Reversibility**: Fully reversible (drop tables, remove API routes)

### Rollback Considerations

**Standard Rollback**: Yes - 3-command rollback via runbook

**Special Rollback Needs**: None (tables can be dropped, no data dependencies)

**Deployment Metadata**: Deploy IDs tracked in specs/048-multi-track-newsletter/NOTES.md (Deployment Metadata section)

---

## Measurement Plan

> **Purpose**: Define how success will be measured using Claude Code-accessible sources.
> **Sources**: SQL queries, structured logs, Lighthouse CI, database aggregates.

### Data Collection

**Analytics Events** (dual instrumentation):
- Database (primary): `newsletter_subscribers`, `newsletter_preferences` tables
- Structured logs (secondary): `logger.info({ event: 'newsletter_signup', email_masked, newsletterTypes, source })`

**Key Events to Track**:
1. `newsletter.signup_started` - User lands on signup form
2. `newsletter.signup_completed` - Subscriber created successfully
3. `newsletter.signup_error` - Validation or API error
4. `newsletter.preference_updated` - User changes preferences
5. `newsletter.unsubscribed` - User unsubscribes from all
6. `newsletter.hard_deleted` - User requests GDPR deletion

### Measurement Queries

**SQL** (`specs/048-multi-track-newsletter/queries/*.sql`):

**Total Subscribers**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM newsletter_subscribers WHERE active = true;
```

**Subscribers by Newsletter Type**:
```sql
SELECT
  np.newsletter_type,
  COUNT(DISTINCT np.subscriber_id) as subscriber_count
FROM newsletter_preferences np
JOIN newsletter_subscribers ns ON ns.id = np.subscriber_id
WHERE np.subscribed = true AND ns.active = true
GROUP BY np.newsletter_type
ORDER BY subscriber_count DESC;
```

**Signup Conversion Rate** (if tracking page views):
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT ns.id) * 1.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM page_views WHERE page = '/') as conversion_rate
FROM newsletter_subscribers ns
WHERE ns.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

**30-Day Retention**:
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE active = true) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as retention_pct
FROM newsletter_subscribers
WHERE subscribed_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

**Average Newsletters per Subscriber**:
```sql
SELECT
  AVG(newsletter_count) as avg_newsletters_per_subscriber
FROM (
  SELECT
    subscriber_id,
    COUNT(*) as newsletter_count
  FROM newsletter_preferences
  WHERE subscribed = true
  GROUP BY subscriber_id
) subquery;
```

**Logs** (`logs/newsletter/*.jsonl`):
- Signup errors: `grep '"event":"newsletter.signup_error"' logs/newsletter/*.jsonl | jq -r '.error_type' | sort | uniq -c`
- Signup sources: `grep '"event":"newsletter.signup_completed"' logs/newsletter/*.jsonl | jq -r '.source' | sort | uniq -c`

**Lighthouse** (`.lighthouseci/results/*.json`):
- Accessibility score for preference page: `jq '.categories.accessibility.score' < results.json`

### Experiment Design (A/B Test)

**Not applicable for MVP** - Single implementation path

**Future Testing**:
- Variant A: Multi-select checkboxes (current design)
- Variant B: Dropdown menu with multi-select
- Metric: Signup completion rate
- Ramp: 50/50 split for 2 weeks
