# Specification Quality Checklist: SEO & Analytics Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: specs/004-seo-analytics/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - **Status**: PASS - Spec describes requirements, not specific implementation (mentions packages as examples, not mandates)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
  - **Status**: PASS - All requirements tied to discoverability, tracking, and content strategy goals
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - **Status**: PASS - User stories in plain language, technical details in separate sections
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed
  - **Status**: PASS - All template sections present and filled

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3)
  - **Status**: PASS - Zero clarification markers (all assumptions documented)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - **Status**: PASS - Every FR has testable acceptance criteria (e.g., "view page source, verify <title> tag")
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status**: PASS - All success criteria have quantifiable metrics (95%+ tracking, <1.5s FCP, etc.)
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - **Status**: PASS - Criteria focus on outcomes (search indexing, rich previews, tracking rate), not tech stack
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status**: PASS - 5 acceptance scenarios + 4 edge cases documented
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
  - **Status**: PASS - GA4 script failure, missing meta data, build time limits, ad blockers
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status**: PASS - "Out of Scope" section explicitly excludes Vercel Analytics, A/B testing, heatmaps, etc.
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status**: PASS - Blocked by #33, assumptions documented for performance/SEO/analytics

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - 21 functional requirements, all testable (FR-001 through FR-021)
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status**: PASS - 5 scenarios cover meta tags, sitemap, analytics, social previews, AI crawlers
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - HEART metrics align with 8 success criteria (indexing, previews, tracking, performance)
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status**: PASS - Spec describes "what" (meta tags, analytics tracking), not "how" (specific APIs/code)

## Notes

**Summary**: All 16 checklist items passed. Specification is complete and ready for `/plan` phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Zero clarification markers (informed guess strategy applied effectively)
- Comprehensive requirements coverage (SEO + Analytics + LLM-friendly markup)
- Clear success metrics with measurement sources (GSC, GA4, Lighthouse)
- Well-documented assumptions and deployment considerations

**Blockers**: Issue #33 (blog-infrastructure) blocks full value realization, but infrastructure can be implemented for homepage/static pages now

**Recommended Next Phase**: `/plan` (no clarifications needed)
