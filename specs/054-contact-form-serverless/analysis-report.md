| FR-018: Use Zod schema for validation | ✅ | T005 | Validation schema creation task |
| FR-019: Enforce 500 char minimum message length | ✅ | T005, T031 | Schema validation + char counter |
| FR-020: Sanitize HTML/script tags (XSS prevention) | ⚠️ | None | **MEDIUM** - Missing explicit sanitization task |

**Coverage**: 19 of 20 functional requirements (95%)

**Finding M1 (MEDIUM)**: FR-020 XSS sanitization not explicitly tasked
- **Location**: tasks.md
- **Issue**: No task explicitly implements HTML/script tag sanitization
- **Impact**: Potential XSS vulnerability if messages contain malicious scripts
- **Recommendation**: Add task T067 to sanitize user input before email sending (use DOMPurify or strip HTML tags)
- **Alternative**: Verify if Resend automatically sanitizes email content (check during implementation)

#### Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-001 to NFR-010)

| Requirement | Covered? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-------------|----------|----------|-------|
| NFR-001: API response <3s (p95) | ✅ | T010 | Performance target documented |
| NFR-002: Non-blocking email delivery | ✅ | T010 | Fire-and-forget async pattern |
| NFR-003: WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility | ⚠️ | T012 | **MEDIUM** - Basic a11y in form, full audit deferred to US7 (P3) |
| NFR-004: Mobile responsive (375px+) | ✅ | T012 | ContactForm responsive design |
| NFR-005: User-friendly error messages | ✅ | T005, T032 | Custom Zod error messages |

| NFR-010: Handle Resend failures gracefully | ✅ | T060, T061 | Error handling + retry logic |

**Coverage**: 10 of 10 non-functional requirements (100%)

**Finding M2 (MEDIUM)**: NFR-003 accessibility audit incomplete in MVP
- **Location**: spec.md, tasks.md
- **Issue**: US7 (full a11y audit) deferred to P3 (nice-to-have), but NFR-003 states WCAG 2.1 AA is required
- **Impact**: Potential compliance gap if accessibility issues exist
- **Recommendation**: Either promote US7 to P2 OR add basic a11y checks to T012 (keyboard nav, ARIA labels, focus states)
- **Note**: Constitution (line 565-578) mandates WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

All patterns documented and consistent.

#### Dependency Graph Consistency

**Status**: ✅ Task dependencies correctly ordered

Verified dependency chains:
- Phase 2 (T005-T007) → Blocks Phase 3 (US1) ✅ Validation schema needed first
- US1 (T010-T012) → Blocks US2 (T020-T022) ✅ API endpoint must exist for spam protection
- US1 (T012) → Blocks US3 (T030-T032) ✅ Form component needed for validation
- US1 (T010) → Blocks US5 (T050) ✅ Email flow needed for auto-reply

No circular dependencies or missing prerequisites detected.

---

### Ambiguity Detection

#### Vague Terms

**Status**: ✅ No critical ambiguity detected

**Finding L1 (LOW)**: "Expected response time" varies
- **Location**: spec.md line 17 ("24-48 hours"), line 303 ("2-3 business days")
- **Impact**: Minor - inconsistent messaging to users
- **Recommendation**: Standardize to "2-3 business days" throughout (spec line 303 is more professional)

**Finding L2 (LOW)**: "Fire-and-forget" email sending unclear
- **Location**: plan.md line 139, task T010
- **Issue**: Async email pattern not explicitly defined (Promise.all? Sequential? Background job?)
- **Impact**: Implementation ambiguity
- **Recommendation**: Clarify in T010 description: "Send admin email (await), send auto-reply (fire-and-forget, no await)"

#### Placeholder Detection

**Status**: ✅ No unresolved placeholders

Scanned for: TODO, TKTK, ???, TBD, <placeholder>
- No placeholders found in spec.md, plan.md, or tasks.md

---

### Underspecification Analysis

#### Missing Component Definitions

**Status**: ✅ All components defined

Verified components in plan.md [NEW INFRASTRUCTURE - CREATE]:
1. app/api/contact/route.ts ✅ Fully specified (line 220-230)
2. lib/contact/validation-schema.ts ✅ Schema fields defined (line 232-241)
3. lib/contact/turnstile-verifier.ts ✅ Function signature defined (line 243-249)
4. lib/contact/email-templates.ts ✅ Template structure defined (line 251-263)
5. app/contact/page.tsx ✅ Layout specified (line 265-270)
6. components/contact/ContactForm.tsx ✅ Fields and states defined (line 272-294)
7. .env.example ✅ Variables documented (line 296-306)

No undefined components referenced in tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria Completeness

**Status**: ✅ All user stories have acceptance criteria

Verified in spec.md:
- US1 (line 40-42): ✅ Form submission, email delivery criteria
- US2 (line 45-47): ✅ Spam rejection rate, Turnstile validation
- US3 (line 50-52): ✅ Inline validation errors, specific messages
- US4 (line 57-59): ✅ Rate limit threshold, 429 response
- US5 (line 62-64): ✅ Auto-reply delivery, content requirements
- US6 (line 69-71): ✅ Database storage (deferred)
- US7 (line 74-76): ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (deferred)

All acceptance criteria are testable.

---

### Duplication Detection

**Status**: ✅ No significant duplication detected

**Finding L3 (LOW)**: Minor task overlap
- **Tasks**: T004 (env schema), T003 (.env.example), T066 (.env.example docs)
- **Overlap**: All three tasks touch environment variables
- **Impact**: Low - sequential tasks, no conflict
- **Recommendation**: Merge T003 and T066 into single task (update .env.example with docs)

---

### Test Coverage Analysis

**Status**: ⚠️ Partial test coverage planned

**Finding L4 (LOW)**: No explicit unit test tasks
- **Location**: tasks.md
- **Issue**: Integration testing preferred (tasks.md line 65-68), but no unit test tasks for utilities
- **Impact**: Low - spec doesn't require TDD, but constitution (line 525-542) mandates 80%+ coverage
- **Recommendation**: Add test tasks for:
  - T005a: Unit tests for validation-schema.ts (Zod schema edge cases)
  - T006a: Unit tests for turnstile-verifier.ts (mock Cloudflare API)
  - T007a: Unit tests for email-templates.ts (template rendering)

**Current test coverage**:
- Integration tests: T064 (health check), T062 (analytics instrumentation)
- Manual testing: Mentioned in plan.md (line 436-482), but not tasked
- E2E tests: Not mentioned (acceptable for MVP)

**Recommendation**: Add Phase 9 for test tasks after implementation (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR pattern)

---

### Migration Requirements

**Status**: ✅ No migrations needed for MVP

Verified:
- Database: No schema changes (spec line 152: "Email-only storage for MVP")
- API: New endpoint only (POST /api/contact), no breaking changes
- Environment: New variables documented (T003, T004)

Future migration (US6 - Priority 3):
- ContactMessage entity (spec line 147-151)
- Migration deferred and documented ✅

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- ✅ Tech stack proven (reusing 8 existing components)
- ✅ Deployment model clear (direct-prod, Hetzner VPS)
- ✅ Breaking changes: None (additive feature)
- ✅ Rollback: Fully reversible (git revert)

### Medium Risk
- ⚠️ **Accessibility compliance** (NFR-003 vs US7 priority mismatch)
- ⚠️ **XSS sanitization** (FR-020 not explicitly tasked)

### Mitigation Recommendations
1. **Accessibility**: Add basic a11y checks to T012 (ARIA labels, keyboard nav, focus states)
2. **XSS**: Add T067 to sanitize HTML/script tags before email sending
3. **Testing**: Add Phase 9 with unit test tasks for utilities

---

## Next Actions

**Status**: ✅ Ready for Implementation

### Immediate Actions (Required)
1. **Review Findings M1 and M2** with stakeholder (Marcus)
   - Decision: Add XSS sanitization task? (Recommended)
   - Decision: Promote US7 to P2 OR add basic a11y to T012? (Recommended)

2. **Optional Improvements** (Low priority)
   - Standardize "response time" terminology (24-48h vs 2-3 days)
   - Clarify "fire-and-forget" email pattern in T010
   - Merge T003 and T066 (env docs)
   - Add Phase 9 unit test tasks

### Proceed to Implementation
If no changes needed:
```bash
/implement
```

**Implementation will**:
1. Execute 29 tasks from tasks.md (Phases 1-8)
2. Follow TDD where applicable (integration tests preferred)
3. Reference existing patterns (email-service.ts, rate-limiter.ts, validation-schemas.ts)
4. Commit after each phase completion
5. Update error-log.md if issues arise

**Estimated Duration**: 12-14 hours (MVP - Phases 1-5), 6-8 hours (Enhancement - Phases 6-8)
