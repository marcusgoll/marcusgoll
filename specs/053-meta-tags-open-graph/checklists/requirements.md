# Specification Quality Checklist: Meta Tags & Open Graph

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: specs/053-meta-tags-open-graph/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3) - Zero clarifications needed
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous - All FRs have specific outputs
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable - HEART metrics with specific targets
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - Focused on outcomes
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined - 5 scenarios covering main user flows
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified - 4 edge cases documented
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded - Out of scope section lists 7 deferred items
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified - 6 assumptions, dependencies section complete

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 10 FRs with specific metadata requirements
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows - Homepage, blog posts, sections, tag pages, newsletter
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - CTR improvement hypothesis with HEART metrics
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification - Spec focuses on what, not how

## Notes

- All checklist items pass ✅
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- No clarifications needed - feature requirements are clear
- MVP strategy defined: US1, US2, US3 (core metadata) → US4, US5 (enhancements) → US6 (future)
- Existing blog post metadata implementation serves as reference pattern
