# Specification Quality Checklist: SSL/TLS with Let's Encrypt

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: specs/048-ssl-tls-letsencrypt/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs (security, SEO, trust)
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders (clear user stories)
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (0 found)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous (verification methods provided)
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable (SSL Labs A+, zero expiry incidents, 100% redirect)
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (outcomes-based: security rating, uptime, user experience)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined (6 scenarios with Given/When/Then)
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified (4 edge cases with mitigation)
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded (MVP vs Enhancement vs Nice-to-have)
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified (5 assumptions, 2 blocking dependencies documented)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (7 FRs with verification methods)
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows (certificate issuance, renewal, redirect, persistence)
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (operational metrics defined)
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification (Caddy mentioned as platform, not implementation)

## Notes

**Status**: All checklist items passed âœ…

**Zero Clarifications**: Specification is complete and unambiguous. Infrastructure feature with clear requirements based on:
- Existing Caddyfile configuration (infrastructure/Caddyfile)
- Let's Encrypt standard practices (HTTP-01 challenge, 90-day expiry, auto-renewal)
- SSL Labs grading criteria (A+ rating requirements)
- Tech stack documentation (docs/project/tech-stack.md)

**Ready for Planning**: Specification approved for /plan phase. No blocking issues.
