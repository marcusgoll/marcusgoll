## Dependency Analysis

### Prerequisites Documented

- DNS configuration (spec.md A-001, tasks.md T003, T010)
- Ports 80/443 open (spec.md A-002, plan.md DEPLOYMENT ACCEPTANCE)
- Docker + Docker Compose (spec.md A-005)
- Email for Let's Encrypt notifications (spec.md A-004)

### Blocked By

From spec.md Related Documentation:
- Blocked by: #26 (docker-compose-orchestration)
- Blocked by: #27 (tech-stack-production-infra)

**Verification Status**: Not validated (would need to check GitHub Issues)
**Recommendation**: Verify blockers resolved before /implement

### File Dependencies

- infrastructure/Caddyfile (exists, will modify)
- docker-compose.prod.yml (exists, will modify)
- Dockerfile (exists, no changes needed)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risks Documented

From plan.md RISKS & MITIGATIONS:

1. **DNS Not Configured** - Medium probability, deployment checklist mitigates
2. **Let's Encrypt Rate Limit** - Low probability, persistent volume mitigates
3. **HSTS Lock-Out** - Very low probability, conservative 6-month max-age mitigates
4. **Certificate Renewal Failure** - Very low probability, automatic retry mitigates
5. **Port 80/443 Conflict** - Low probability, pre-flight check mitigates

All risks have documented mitigations and contingency plans.

---

## Quality Gates

### From Spec.md

- Requirements testable, no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- Constitution aligned (security, performance, reliability)
- No implementation details (specific commands, code)
- Skipped - Infrastructure feature, no user behavior tracking
- Skipped - Infrastructure/backend feature, no UI components
- Breaking changes identified (None - fully backward compatible)
- Environment variables documented (None required)
- Rollback plan specified (HSTS caching caveat documented)
- DNS prerequisite documented (deployment checklist)

All quality gates satisfied.

## Findings

### Category: Positive Findings

| ID | Category | Location | Summary |
|----|----------|----------|---------|
| P1 | Excellence | All artifacts | Complete traceability: requirements to tasks |
| P2 | Best Practice | plan.md | Comprehensive risk analysis with mitigations |
| P3 | Best Practice | tasks.md | Parallel execution opportunities identified (11 tasks) |
| P4 | Completeness | spec.md | Edge cases documented with expected behavior |
| P5 | Best Practice | plan.md | Rollback plan includes HSTS caching consideration |

### Category: Validation Checks

All validation checks passed. No issues found.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Before /implement**: Verify GitHub Issues #26 and #27 are resolved (blockers)
2. **During /implement**: Follow task order (Phase 1 to Phase 2 to Phase 3 to Phase 4 to Phase 5)
3. **Post-deployment**: Wait 72 hours before SSL Labs scan (certificate caching)
4. **Future enhancement**: Consider US5 (monitoring) after 3-6 months of operation
5. **Content opportunity**: Document SSL setup process as teaching content (aviation checklist parallel)

---

## Next Phase

**Ready for**: /implement

**Confidence Level**: High
- Zero blocking issues
- Complete requirement coverage
- Constitution aligned
- All dependencies documented
- Risks identified and mitigated

**Estimated Implementation Time**: 6-8 hours (per tasks.md)
