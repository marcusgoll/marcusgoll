# Feature Specification: Homepage with Enhanced Post Feed

**Feature ID**: 003-homepage-post-feed
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Draft
**Author**: Marcus Gollahon

---

## Purpose

Enhance the existing homepage post feed with improved content discovery, flexible viewing options, and better user engagement through filtering, featured content highlighting, and pagination capabilities.

**Current State**: The homepage displays the latest 3 posts from each content track (aviation and dev-startup) in separate sections with no filtering, featured content highlighting, or pagination.

**Desired State**: Users can view posts in dual-track sections (current) or a unified chronological feed, filter by content track, see featured posts prominently, and load more posts without leaving the page.

---

## User Stories

### Story 1: View All Posts in Unified Feed

**Given** I am a visitor on the homepage
**When** I select "All Posts" or a unified view option
**Then** I see all posts from both tracks displayed chronologically regardless of track
**And** each post displays its track badge for easy identification
**And** the URL updates to reflect the unified view (?view=unified)

### Story 2: Filter Posts by Content Track

**Given** I am viewing the homepage post feed
**When** I select a specific track filter (Aviation, Dev/Startup, Cross-pollination, or All)
**Then** I see only posts from the selected track
**And** the filter selection is reflected in the URL (?track=aviation)
**And** the filter state persists when I navigate back to the homepage

### Story 3: Discover Featured Content

**Given** I am a visitor on the homepage
**When** the page loads
**Then** I see up to 2 featured posts prominently displayed at the top
**And** featured posts use larger cards or hero-style layout to stand out
**And** if no featured posts exist, the section is hidden gracefully

### Story 4: Load More Posts

**Given** I am viewing the homepage and have scrolled through the initial posts
**When** I click the "Load More" button
**Then** the next 6 posts are fetched and appended to the current list
**And** my scroll position is maintained
**And** the button shows a loading state while fetching
**And** the button is hidden when no more posts are available

### Story 5: Maintain Dual-Track View

**Given** I am a visitor familiar with the current homepage layout
**When** I visit the homepage without any filter parameters
**Then** I see the existing dual-track sections (Aviation and Dev/Startup) by default
**And** each section shows 3 recent posts
**And** I can toggle to unified view if desired

## Context Strategy & Signal Design

### Initial Load Context
- **Signals**: URL parameters (`?view=`, `?track=`), user device type (mobile/desktop)
- **Default Behavior**: Dual-track view with 3 posts per track
- **State Management**: URL params as single source of truth for view/filter state

### Filter Interaction
- **User Signal**: Click/tap on track filter button
- **System Response**: Update URL params, re-render post list client-side
- **Feedback**: Active filter visually highlighted, post count updates, loading indicator if needed

### Load More Interaction
- **User Signal**: Click "Load More" button
- **System Response**: Fetch next batch of posts via API, append to current list
- **Feedback**: Button shows loading spinner, new posts fade in, scroll position maintained

### Featured Posts Discovery
- **Automatic**: Featured posts automatically displayed at top on page load
- **Priority**: Featured posts take precedence over chronological order
- **Exclusion**: Featured posts excluded from regular feed to avoid duplication

---

## Success Criteria

1. **User Engagement**: Users can successfully filter posts by track and view results
2. **Content Discovery**: Featured posts are prominently displayed and easily identifiable
3. **Pagination Usability**: Users can load additional posts without losing context
4. **Performance**: Homepage load time remains under 2 seconds (FCP) with new features
5. **Accessibility**: All new interactive elements are keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly
6. **Mobile Experience**: Filter and pagination work seamlessly on mobile devices
7. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing homepage functionality remains intact

---

## Assumptions

1. **Content Volume**: Assume sufficient posts exist to make pagination valuable (20+ total posts)
2. **Featured Post Selection**: Content authors will manually mark posts as `featured: true` in frontmatter
3. **Browser Support**: Modern browsers supporting ES6+ and Next.js requirements
4. **Image Optimization**: Featured images exist for all posts and are optimized
5. **Track Tags**: All posts are properly tagged with at least one track (aviation, dev-startup, or cross-pollination)
6. **ISR Revalidation**: 60-second revalidation is acceptable for showing latest content
7. **Client-Side Filtering**: Client-side filtering is acceptable for performance (not large enough dataset to require server-side)

---

## Out of Scope

- Search functionality (text-based post search)
- Sorting options (most popular, trending, oldest first)
- User authentication or personalized feeds
- Post bookmarking or favorites
- Social sharing buttons on homepage cards
- Infinite scroll (using "Load More" button instead)
- Tag-based filtering beyond primary track tags
- Date range filtering
- Advanced search filters (author, date published, reading time)

---

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- React 19.2.0+
- Existing Post data model and API functions (`lib/posts.ts`)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Feature Complexity Overwhelming Users
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Default to familiar dual-track view
- Make filter UI simple and intuitive
- Progressive disclosure (don't show all options at once)
- User testing with target audience

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation with More Posts
**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**:
- Limit initial load to 6 posts
- Implement efficient pagination
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in production
- Optimize images and use lazy loading

### Risk 3: SEO Impact from URL Parameters
**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Use canonical URLs pointing to default homepage
- Add `noindex` to filtered views if necessary
- Test Google Search Console for crawl issues
- Monitor organic traffic post-launch

### Risk 4: Content Imbalance (Too Few Posts in One Track)
**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Show empty state messaging with CTA to other track
- Highlight cross-pollination posts when one track is sparse
- Content calendar to ensure balanced publishing

## Open Questions

None at this time. All design decisions have been made based on existing implementation and brand guidelines.

## Notes

This specification assumes the existing homepage implementation is the baseline and enhances it with filtering, featured content, and pagination. The dual-track layout remains the default to preserve familiarity and brand positioning (40/40/20 content mix).

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/plan` phase to generate design artifacts and technical implementation plan.
