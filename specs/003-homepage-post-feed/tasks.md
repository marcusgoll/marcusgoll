## [DEPENDENCY GRAPH]
Story completion order:
1. Phase 1: Setup (prerequisite infrastructure)
2. Phase 2: Foundational Components (blocks all stories)
3. Phase 3: US1 [P1] - Unified feed view (independent)
4. Phase 4: US2 [P2] - Track filtering (depends on US1 UnifiedPostFeed)
5. Phase 5: US3 [P2] - Featured content (independent, can parallel with US2)
6. Phase 6: US4 [P1] - Load More pagination (depends on US1 UnifiedPostFeed)
7. Phase 7: US5 [P3] - Maintain dual-track view (verify backward compatibility)
8. Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

## [PARALLEL EXECUTION OPPORTUNITIES]
- Phase 2: T002, T003, T004 (different files, independent components)
- Phase 3: T010, T011 (different concerns - URL handling vs display)
- Phase 5: T020, T021 (featured posts independent of filtering)
- Phase 6: T025, T026 (pagination logic vs button UI)
- Phase 8: T040, T041, T042, T043 (different testing/optimization concerns)

## [IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY]
**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-4 (Setup â†’ Foundational â†’ Unified Feed â†’ Filtering)
**Incremental delivery**:
- Phase 1-2: Foundation (components/infrastructure)
- Phase 3-4: Core functionality (unified feed + filtering) â†’ staging validation
- Phase 5-6: Enhanced features (featured posts + pagination) â†’ staging validation
- Phase 7-8: Polish + optimization â†’ production deployment

**Testing approach**: Optional - manual testing only (no test directory found in codebase)
**Analytics**: Track filter selections, view mode changes, pagination clicks, featured post impressions

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Error Handling & Resilience

- [ ] T040 [P] Add loading states to UnifiedPostFeed component
  - Skeleton: Show skeleton cards while posts loading (if async)
  - Empty state: "No posts found" message when filteredPosts.length === 0
  - Error state: "Failed to load posts" with retry button
  - Pattern: React Suspense boundaries or conditional rendering
  - From: plan.md [PERFORMANCE TARGETS]

- [ ] T041 [P] Add URL parameter validation to PostFeedFilter
  - Validate: ?track param must be 'aviation' | 'dev-startup' | 'cross-pollination' | 'all'
  - Validate: ?view param must be 'unified' or undefined
  - Sanitize: Remove invalid params, default to safe values
  - Security: Prevent XSS via param injection (React handles via JSX)
  - From: plan.md [SECURITY]

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] T042 [P] Optimize UnifiedPostFeed rendering performance
  - Memoization: useMemo for filteredPosts computation
  - Key props: Ensure unique keys for PostCard components (post.slug)
  - Lazy loading: Consider lazy-loading images in PostCard (existing or add)
  - Bundle: Verify code-splitting for client components
  - Target: FCP <1.5s, LCP <2.5s
  - Pattern: React.memo, useMemo for expensive computations
  - From: plan.md [PERFORMANCE TARGETS]

- [ ] T043 [P] Add analytics instrumentation
  - Events: 'view_mode_changed', 'track_filter_changed', 'load_more_clicked', 'featured_post_clicked'
  - Properties: Include mode/track/count values
  - PostHog: Use existing PageViewTracker pattern for event tracking
  - Logs: Console log for development debugging
  - REUSE: PageViewTracker component (components/analytics/PageViewTracker.tsx)
  - Pattern: Existing analytics implementation in codebase
  - From: plan.md [SECURITY - Analytics]

### Accessibility Audit

- [ ] T044 [P] Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for new components
  - Keyboard: Tab navigation through filters, buttons
  - Screen readers: aria-label on filter buttons, aria-pressed on toggles
  - Focus: Visible focus indicators on interactive elements
  - Contrast: Verify text/background contrast ratios â‰¥4.5:1
  - Announcements: Announce filter changes, new posts loaded
  - Test: Use axe DevTools or Lighthouse accessibility audit
  - From: plan.md [PERFORMANCE TARGETS - Accessibility]

### Documentation

- [ ] T045 Update NOTES.md with implementation decisions
  - Document: Component architecture decisions
  - Document: URL parameter schema (?view, ?track)
  - Document: Pagination strategy (client-side slicing)
  - Document: Known limitations (no infinite scroll, no search)
  - From: Standard practice

- [ ] T046 Create quickstart testing guide in specs/003-homepage-post-feed/
  - Steps: How to test each user story manually
  - URLs: Example URLs with different param combinations
  - Edge cases: Empty states, no featured posts, all posts loaded
  - From: spec.md user stories
