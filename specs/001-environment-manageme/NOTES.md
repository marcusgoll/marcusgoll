# Feature: Environment Management (.env)

## Overview

**Roadmap Issue**: #31 (ICE Score: 4.00 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Branch**: feature/001-environment-manageme
**Slug**: environment-manageme

Implement secure environment variable management with .env files for configuration across development, staging, and production environments.

**Key Benefits**:
- Secure configuration management (no secrets in git)
- Multi-environment support (dev, staging, production)
- Clear developer onboarding (documented .env.example)
- Runtime validation (fail fast on misconfiguration)

## Feature Classification
- UI screens: false
- Improvement: false
- Measurable: false
- Deployment impact: true

Research mode: Minimal (infrastructure feature)

## Research Findings

### From Constitution (constitution.md)
- **Project Type**: Personal Website/Blog (Aviation + Dev/Startup content)
- **Deployment Model**: staging-prod (auto-detected based on git config)
- **Brand Mission**: "I help pilots advance their aviation careers and teach developers to build with systematic thinking"
- **Engineering Principles**: Code quality, testing, deployment practices must align
- **Tech Stack Context**: Next.js-based personal website with Ghost CMS backend

### From Roadmap Issue #31
- **Feature**: Environment Management (.env)
- **Impact**: 4/5 - Critical for security and multi-environment support
- **Effort**: 1/5 - Very simple implementation
- **Score**: 4.00 (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **Dependencies**: Blocked by tech-stack-foundation-core (#1)
- **Requirements**: 12 detailed requirements documented in issue body

### Research Conclusions
1. **Scope**: Infrastructure feature - no UI components needed
2. **Priority**: Highest-scored feature in roadmap (4.00)
3. **Security Focus**: Must ensure no secrets committed to git
4. **Multi-Environment**: Support dev (.env.local) and prod (.env.production)
5. **Integration Points**: Next.js, Docker Compose, Ghost CMS, MySQL
6. **Validation**: Runtime validation of required environment variables
