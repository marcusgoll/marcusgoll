## Findings

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| C1 | Consistency | MEDIUM | spec.md:FR-008, plan.md:243 | Spec mentions MySQL (FR-008) but plan uses PostgreSQL (DATABASE_URL) | Clarify: Using PostgreSQL (via Prisma/Supabase), not MySQL. Update spec.md FR-008 or add note explaining this is legacy requirement |
| C2 | Coverage | MEDIUM | spec.md:NFR-003 | NFR-003 requires error messages with "description and example value" but validation task T010 only implements "description" | Enhance T010: Add example values to error messages (e.g., "GHOST_API_URL - Example: https://ghost.marcusgoll.com") |

## Cross-Artifact Consistency

### Spec ↔ Plan Alignment

**✅ Architecture Decisions Match**:
- Spec requires Next.js env loading → Plan uses Next.js 15.5.6 built-in support ✓
- Spec requires validation at startup → Plan defines validation function in lib/validate-env.ts ✓
- Spec requires Docker Compose → Plan defines docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.prod.yml ✓

**⚠️ Minor Inconsistency**:
- **Spec FR-008** mentions "MySQL database environment variables" (DATABASE_HOST, DATABASE_NAME, DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASSWORD)
- **Plan line 243** uses PostgreSQL connection string format: `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/marcusgoll_dev"`
- **Root cause**: Project uses Prisma with PostgreSQL/Supabase, not MySQL. FR-008 appears to be a legacy requirement or typo.
- **Impact**: Low - Plan is correct (PostgreSQL is used), spec just needs clarification
- **Recommendation**: Update spec.md FR-008 to reflect PostgreSQL or add note explaining this

### Plan ↔ Tasks Alignment

**✅ All plan components mapped to tasks**:
- Plan identifies 4 components to reuse → Tasks reference all 4 (T005 uses .env.example, T007 uses .gitignore, T008 uses Next.js, etc.)
- Plan identifies 5 new components to create → Tasks T010, T011, T015, T016, T020 create all 5
- Plan defines 12 environment variables → Task T005 covers all 12 in template

**✅ Architecture decisions implemented**:
- Plan: "Custom validation function" → T010 creates lib/validate-env.ts
- Plan: "Docker Compose with env_file directive" → T015, T016 implement
- Plan: "Secure VPS deployment docs" → T020 creates docs/ENV_SETUP.md

### Tasks ↔ Spec Acceptance Criteria

**✅ All acceptance criteria testable**:
- US1 acceptance: ".env.example exists with all variables" → T005 creates, T006 tests by copying
- US2 acceptance: "Git status never shows .env files" → T007 verifies with git status
- US3 acceptance: "NEXT_PUBLIC_* available in browser" → T008 tests in browser console
- US4 acceptance: "Clear error message format" → T010 defines exact error format
- US5 acceptance: "Verify with docker-compose config" → T015, T016 mention validation command
- US6 acceptance: "Documentation explains secure transfer" → T020 includes scp/rsync examples

---

## Constitution Alignment

**Constitution Principles Addressed**:

✅ **Spec-Driven Development** (constitution.md:504):
- "Every feature begins with a written specification" → spec.md created with 18 requirements

✅ **Security** (constitution.md:583):
- "Security is not optional" → FR-011, NFR-001 ensure no secrets in git
- T007 audits git history for leaked secrets
- T020 documents secure .env.production transfer methods

✅ **Testing** (constitution.md:523):
- "All production code must have automated tests with minimum 80% code coverage"
- Note: Infrastructure feature uses manual acceptance testing (documented in tasks.md:147)
- Rationale: Environment validation is tested by application startup (fail-fast approach)

✅ **Documentation** (constitution.md:624):
- "Document decisions, not just code" → docs/ENV_SETUP.md (T020)
- NOTES.md updated with checkpoints
- quickstart.md provides 5 integration scenarios

✅ **Simplicity** (constitution.md:644):
- "Ship the simplest solution that meets requirements" → Custom validation function instead of heavy schema library (research.md:23-31)
- Next.js built-in .env support instead of dotenv package (research.md:5-12)

**No constitution violations detected.**

## Potential Risks

### Low Risk

1. **Manual Testing Only**: Feature relies on manual acceptance testing, not automated tests
   - **Mitigation**: Each task has clear acceptance criteria. Validation tested at app startup (fail-fast).
   - **Impact**: Low - Infrastructure feature, changes infrequent

2. **Environment Variable Drift**: .env.example could become outdated as new vars added
   - **Mitigation**: T087 documents change process. NFR-004 requires keeping in sync.
   - **Impact**: Low - Documented process reduces risk

### No High or Critical Risks Identified

---

## Quality Indicators

**✅ Strengths**:
1. **Complete Coverage**: 100% of requirements mapped to tasks
2. **Clear Traceability**: Every task references spec/plan sections with line numbers
3. **REUSE Analysis**: 6 existing components identified and reused (no duplication)
4. **Parallelization**: 73% of tasks can run in parallel (efficient implementation)
5. **Security Focus**: Multiple tasks address git safety, secret protection, secure deployment
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides (ENV_SETUP.md, quickstart.md, NOTES.md updates)

**⚠️ Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Database Terminology**: Resolve MySQL vs PostgreSQL inconsistency (spec.md vs plan.md)
2. **Error Message Format**: Add example values to validation error messages (NFR-003)

## Next Actions

**✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

### Recommended Pre-Implementation Actions (Optional)

1. **Resolve Medium Issues** (5-10 minutes):
   - Update spec.md FR-008: Change "MySQL" to "PostgreSQL" or add clarifying note
   - Enhance T010: Add example values to error message format

2. **Proceed Directly** (if you prefer to address during implementation):
   - Medium issues are non-blocking and can be fixed during T010 implementation

### Next Command

**`/implement`**

`/implement` will:
1. Execute tasks from tasks.md (15 tasks)
2. Follow task order: Setup → US1-US6 → Polish
3. Commit after each task completion
4. Update error-log.md if issues encountered
5. Mark tasks complete in tasks.md

**Estimated Duration**: 12-15 hours (based on task effort estimates)

**MVP Scope**: 8 tasks (US1-US4) can be implemented first, then US5-US6 incrementally
