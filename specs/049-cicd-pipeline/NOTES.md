# Feature: CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

## Overview
Implement automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for continuous testing, building, and deployment to VPS on every push to main branch.

## System Components Analysis

## Checkpoints
- Phase 0 (Spec): 2025-10-28

## Last Updated
2025-10-28T19:30:00Z

## Feature Classification
- UI screens: false (infrastructure/automation feature)
- Improvement: false (new capability, not improving existing)
- Measurable: true (deployment time, build success rate, pipeline reliability)
- Deployment impact: true (CI/CD infrastructure, environment variables, secrets management)

Rationale: CI/CD pipeline is an infrastructure feature focused on automation. No user-facing UI screens, but has measurable outcomes (build time, deployment success rate) and significant deployment impact (requires GitHub secrets, SSH keys, environment configuration).

## Research Findings

### Existing Infrastructure (from codebase analysis)

**Current CI/CD State**:
- `.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml`: Basic build/lint/typecheck workflow (runs on PR/push to main)
- `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`: Placeholder deployment workflow mentioning Dokploy auto-deployment
- Docker support: Multi-stage Dockerfile (development, builder, production stages)
- Docker Compose: `docker-compose.prod.yml` with Next.js + Caddy reverse proxy setup
- Current deployment: Manual via Dokploy (push to main triggers auto-deploy to test.marcusgoll.com)

**Tech Stack** (from tech-stack.md):
- Frontend: Next.js 15.5.6 (App Router), TypeScript 5.9.3, Tailwind CSS 4.1.15
- Backend: Next.js API Routes (minimal usage - /api/newsletter)
- Database: PostgreSQL 15+ via self-hosted Supabase
- ORM: Prisma 6.17.1
- Hosting: Hetzner VPS + Docker + Caddy reverse proxy
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (basic build/test only, no deployment automation yet)

**Deployment Strategy** (from deployment-strategy.md):
- Model: direct-prod (no staging environment yet)
- VPS: Hetzner self-hosted (~â‚¬20-30/mo)
- Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose
- Current deployment: Push to main â†’ Dokploy auto-deployment (via webhook)
- Future: Migrate to staging-prod model when traffic > 10K/mo

### Current Gaps
1. No automated Docker build/push to registry (GHCR or Docker Hub)
2. No automated SSH deployment to VPS
3. No rollback automation (currently manual: docker images + git revert)
4. No secrets management via GitHub Secrets
5. No deployment notifications (Slack/Discord)
6. No performance optimization (dependency caching not configured)
7. Lint/typecheck steps use continue-on-error (non-blocking)

### Project Architecture Compliance
- Constitution specifies direct-prod deployment model âœ…
- Quality gates defined: pre-flight validation, code review gate, manual preview gate âœ…
- Rollback strategy documented: Docker image tags + git revert âœ…
- Version management: Semantic versioning via package.json âœ…
- Target: < 10 minute pipeline execution âœ…

### GitHub Actions Maturity
- Basic workflow exists but incomplete
- No build caching configured
- No Docker layer caching
- No matrix builds for multiple Node versions
- No artifact storage
- No deployment automation to VPS

### Decision: Extend Existing vs Replace
**Recommendation**: Extend existing workflows rather than replace
- Rationale: Basic structure is sound, just needs deployment automation
- Keep build-and-test.yml for PR validation
- Enhance deploy-production.yml with full CI/CD automation
- Add secrets for VPS SSH, Docker registry credentials

## Specification Complete

**Status**: âœ… Validated and ready for planning

**Metrics**:
- User Stories: 8 (MVP: US1-US3, Enhancement: US4-US6, Nice-to-have: US7-US8)
- Functional Requirements: 8 (FR-001 through FR-008)
- Non-Functional Requirements: 5 (performance, reliability, security, observability, idempotency)
- Acceptance Scenarios: 6 primary + 5 edge cases
- Out of Scope: 9 items explicitly excluded
- Clarifications Needed: 0 (all questions answered by project docs)

**Key Technical Decisions**:
1. GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) for Docker images (free, native integration)
2. SSH-based deployment via appleboy/ssh-action (direct control, existing VPS setup)
3. Docker tag-based rollback (fast, reliable, no rebuild)
4. Extend existing workflows rather than create new (maintains consistency)

**Validation**:
- Requirements checklist: 16/16 passed âœ…
- Aligned with constitution.md deployment model (direct-prod) âœ…
- Validated against tech-stack.md and deployment-strategy.md âœ…
- No implementation details in specification âœ…

**Next Phase**: `/plan` - Generate design artifacts for implementation

## Phase 2: Tasks (2025-10-28 14:45)

**Summary**:
- Total tasks: 45
- User story tasks: 30
- Parallel opportunities: 23 tasks marked [P]
- Setup tasks: 3
- Task file: specs/049-cicd-pipeline/tasks.md

**Task Breakdown by Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 3 tasks - Documentation and structure
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 4 tasks - SSH keys and secrets configuration
- Phase 3 (US1 - PR validation): 3 tasks - Lint, type-check, build pipeline
- Phase 4 (US2 - Docker build): 5 tasks - GHCR push with buildx
- Phase 5 (US3 - SSH deployment): 6 tasks - VPS deployment automation
- Phase 6 (US4 - Rollback): 4 tasks - Automatic rollback on failure
- Phase 7 (US5 - Notifications): 3 tasks - Slack/Discord webhooks
- Phase 8 (US6 - Secrets): 3 tasks - Security audit and rotation
- Phase 9 (US7 - Caching): 3 tasks - npm and Docker layer caching
- Phase 10 (US8 - Integration tests): 3 tasks - API contract validation (DEFERRED)
- Phase 11 (Polish): 8 tasks - Deployment tracking, documentation, testing

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-5 (US1-US3) = 22 tasks
- Core CI/CD: PR validation â†’ Docker build â†’ SSH deployment â†’ Health checks
- Estimated: 12-20 hours to MVP

**Reuse Identified**:
- Existing workflow structure (deploy-production.yml)
- Multi-stage Dockerfile (no changes needed)
- docker-compose.prod.yml (pull and restart pattern)
- Caddyfile (SSL + reverse proxy)
- VPS SSH access (ssh hetzner alias)
- Docker healthcheck (/api/health)

**Checkpoint**:
- âœ… Tasks generated: 45 concrete tasks
- âœ… User story organization: Complete (US1-US8)
- âœ… Dependency graph: Created (10 phases with clear dependencies)
- âœ… MVP strategy: Defined (22 tasks for core CI/CD)
- âœ… Parallel opportunities: 23 tasks can run concurrently
- ðŸ“‹ Ready for: /analyze

**Next Phase**: /analyze - Validate architecture, identify risks, generate implementation hints
