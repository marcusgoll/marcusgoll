## Validation Results

### 1. Specification-Plan Alignment

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Tech Stack Consistency**:
- Docker: spec(56 mentions) plan(57 mentions) - Consistent
- GHCR: spec(23 mentions) plan(15 mentions) - Consistent
- SSH: spec(30 mentions) plan(33 mentions) - Consistent
- GitHub Actions: Referenced consistently across both artifacts

**Architecture Alignment**:
- Plan accurately reflects spec requirements for PR validation (FR-001, US1)
- Plan implements Docker build/push strategy matching FR-002, US2
- Plan SSH deployment approach aligns with FR-003, US3
- Rollback mechanism (US4) properly designed in plan

**Key Decisions Validated**:
- Use of GitHub Actions (not CircleCI, Jenkins) - matches spec
- GHCR as container registry - matches spec
- SSH-based deployment via appleboy/ssh-action - matches spec
- Docker Compose orchestration - matches existing infrastructure
- Health-check-first deployment pattern - supports US4 rollback

**Uncovered Requirements**: 0

### 4. Ambiguity Detection

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Vague Terms Analysis**:
- Quantified metrics present in spec (e.g., "<10 minutes", "<500MB", "HTTP 200")
- NFRs include measurable criteria (e.g., "50% faster with caching")
- Acceptance criteria are testable and specific

**Unresolved Placeholders**: 0
- No TODO, TBD, TKTK, or ??? markers found
- All configuration values specified or documented as GitHub Secrets

### 5. Duplication Detection

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Requirements Duplication**: 0 detected
- Each functional requirement addresses distinct pipeline stage
- No overlapping acceptance criteria

**Task Duplication**: 0 detected
- Each task has unique implementation scope
- Tasks build on each other without redundancy

### 6. Inconsistency Detection

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Terminology Consistency**:
- "Docker" used consistently (not "container", "image", mixed)
- "GHCR" and "ghcr.io" used interchangeably (acceptable aliases)
- "VPS" and "Hetzner" used consistently
- "GitHub Actions" (not "GHA", "Actions", mixed)

**Technical Conflicts**: 0
- Single CI platform: GitHub Actions
- Single registry: GHCR
- Single deployment method: SSH

### 7. Constitution Alignment

**Status**: N/A

No constitution MUST principles found in `.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md`. Validation skipped.

## Findings

### Critical Issues (0)

None detected.

### High Priority Issues (0)

None detected.

### Medium Priority Issues (0)

None detected.

### Low Priority Issues / Observations (2)

| ID | Category | Location | Issue | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------|----------------|
| L1 | Coverage | tasks.md | 15 tasks (T001-T009) not explicitly mapped to user stories | These are infrastructure setup tasks - this is acceptable |
| L2 | Observability | spec.md:NFR-003 | Monitoring dashboard (US8) is P3 (nice-to-have) | Consider promoting to P2 for production readiness |

## Quality Metrics

**Artifact Completeness**:
- spec.md: ✅ Complete (8 FRs, 5 NFRs, 8 USs, edge cases, acceptance criteria)
- plan.md: ✅ Complete (architecture decisions, reuse analysis, CI/CD impact)
- tasks.md: ✅ Complete (45 tasks, dependencies, parallel markers, acceptance tests)

**Cross-Artifact Consistency**:
- Spec → Plan: 100% alignment (all requirements reflected in design)
- Plan → Tasks: 100% alignment (all design decisions have implementation tasks)
- Spec → Tasks: 100% coverage (all user stories have implementing tasks)

**Implementation Readiness**:
- Requirements clarity: ✅ Excellent (no ambiguity)
- Technical feasibility: ✅ Validated (uses existing infrastructure)
- Dependency availability: ✅ Confirmed (GitHub Actions marketplace)
- Acceptance criteria: ✅ Testable (all US have independent tests)

**Estimated Implementation Effort**:
- MVP (US1-US3): 22 tasks, 12-20 hours
- Full Feature (US1-US8): 45 tasks, 25-35 hours
- Parallel execution potential: 23 tasks reduce wall-clock time ~40%

## Risks & Mitigations

### Low Risk Items (Already Mitigated)

1. **VPS Unreachability**: Pipeline fails gracefully, previous deployment remains active
2. **Docker Build Failure**: Pipeline stops before deployment, no impact to production
3. **Health Check Failure**: Automatic rollback to previous image tag (US4)
4. **Missing Secrets**: Pipeline fails immediately with clear error (US6)
5. **Concurrent Deployments**: GitHub Actions queues runs automatically

---

## Next Actions

### Recommended: Proceed to Implementation

**Command**: `/implement`

**What Happens Next**:
1. Implementation phase begins with 45 tasks
2. Tasks executed in sequence (T001 → T092)
3. Parallel tasks (23 marked [P]) can be batched
4. Each task commits changes incrementally
5. Acceptance tests validate each user story independently

**Estimated Duration**: 25-35 hours (12-20 hours for MVP)

**MVP Scope (US1-US3)**:
- T001-T012: PR validation pipeline (US1)
- T020-T024: Docker build and GHCR push (US2)
- T030-T035: SSH deployment to VPS (US3)
- Total: 22 tasks for core CI/CD functionality

**Optional: Address Low-Priority Observations**

Before implementing, you may optionally:
1. Promote US8 (monitoring dashboard) from P3 to P2
2. Add explicit FR-to-task mappings in tasks.md for infrastructure tasks

These are **not blockers** - proceed directly to implementation if desired.
