# Specification Quality Checklist: CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: specs/049-cicd-pipeline/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (0 found)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined (6 scenarios with clear Given/When/Then)
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified (5 edge cases documented)
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded (Out of Scope section defines 9 exclusions)
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (FR-001 through FR-008)
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows (6 acceptance scenarios + 6 edge cases)
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: ✅ Excellent

**Summary**:
- All 16 checklist items passed
- 0 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (specification is complete)
- 8 user stories prioritized (MVP: US1-US3, Enhancements: US4-US6, Nice-to-have: US7-US8)
- 8 functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- 5 non-functional requirements with quantified targets
- HEART metrics framework applied (5 dimensions with targets)
- Success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic
- Deployment considerations comprehensively documented
- Out of scope explicitly defined (9 exclusions)
- Dependencies and assumptions clearly stated

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ YES - Proceed to /plan

**No blockers identified** - Specification is clear, complete, and validated against project documentation (tech-stack.md, deployment-strategy.md, constitution.md).
