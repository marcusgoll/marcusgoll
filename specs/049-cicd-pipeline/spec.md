# Feature Specification: CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

**Branch**: `feature/049-cicd-pipeline`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**GitHub Issue**: #29

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Story
As a developer, when I push code to the main branch, I want an automated pipeline to build, test, containerize, and deploy my Next.js application to the VPS, so that deployments are consistent, fast, and error-free.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a feature branch with passing tests, **When** I create a pull request, **Then** the CI pipeline runs linting, type checking, and builds the application without deployment
2. **Given** a merged PR to main branch, **When** the commit is pushed, **Then** the pipeline builds a Docker image, pushes it to GHCR, SSHs to VPS, pulls the image, and restarts containers
3. **Given** a deployment completes successfully, **When** I check the deployment logs, **Then** I see a success notification and the site is live with the new changes
4. **Given** a deployment fails at any stage, **When** I check GitHub Actions, **Then** I see clear error messages and the previous deployment remains active (rollback capability)
5. **Given** the pipeline is running, **When** I check pipeline execution time, **Then** the total time from push to deployment is under 10 minutes
6. **Given** repeated deployments, **When** I compare build times, **Then** dependency caching reduces build time by at least 50% compared to uncached builds

### Edge Cases
- What happens when VPS is unreachable during deployment? (Pipeline fails, deployment tagged as failed, manual retry required)
- What happens when Docker image build fails? (Pipeline stops, no deployment attempted, clear error in logs)
- What happens when health check fails after deployment? (Automatic rollback to previous Docker image tag)
- What happens when GitHub Secrets are missing or invalid? (Pipeline fails immediately with clear error message)
- What happens during concurrent deployments? (GitHub Actions ensures sequential execution, queues subsequent runs)

- Docker buildx cache configured for layer reuse
- First build (cold cache) establishes baseline
- Subsequent builds (warm cache) 50%+ faster than cold cache
- Cache automatically invalidated when dependencies change

**Technical Details**:
- Use `actions/cache@v3` with key: `node-modules-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}`
- Use Docker buildx with `cache-from=type=gha` and `cache-to=type=gha,mode=max`
- Log cache hit/miss for debugging

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance
**Target**: Total pipeline execution time under 10 minutes from push to live site

**Justification**: Fast feedback loop improves developer productivity and enables multiple daily deployments

**Measurement**: GitHub Actions workflow duration from trigger to completion

### NFR-002: Reliability
**Target**: 95%+ deployment success rate (excluding intentional rollbacks)

**Justification**: High reliability builds trust in automation and reduces manual intervention

**Measurement**: Successful deployments / total deployment attempts (tracked in deployment log)

### NFR-003: Security
**Target**: No secrets committed to Git, all credentials stored in GitHub Secrets

**Justification**: Prevents credential leaks and unauthorized access to infrastructure

**Measurement**: Manual audit of Git history and GitHub Secrets configuration

### NFR-004: Observability
**Target**: All deployment steps logged clearly with timestamps and status

**Justification**: Easy debugging of failures and audit trail of deployments

**Measurement**: GitHub Actions workflow logs contain all necessary diagnostic information

### NFR-005: Idempotency
**Target**: Rerunning pipeline with same commit produces identical result

**Justification**: Predictable deployments and safe retries

**Measurement**: Deploy same commit twice, verify identical Docker image and behavior

## Out of Scope

### Explicitly Excluded
- **Staging environment setup**: Current deployment model is direct-prod (no staging)
- **Multi-environment deployments**: Only production deployment automated (staging deferred to future)
- **Database migration automation**: Migrations run manually via `npx prisma migrate deploy` (separate concern)
- **E2E test automation**: Integration/E2E tests not in MVP (US8 is P3)
- **Blue-green deployments**: Single VPS deployment, no traffic splitting
- **Canary deployments**: Not applicable to single-server setup
- **Performance testing in CI**: Lighthouse CI deferred to separate feature
- **Monitoring/alerting setup**: Deployment notifications only, no ongoing monitoring
- **Multi-region deployments**: Single VPS in Europe
- **Automated changelog generation**: Git commit messages sufficient for now

### Future Enhancements
- Staging environment when traffic > 10K/mo (per deployment-strategy.md)
- Integration test suite (US8)
- Lighthouse CI performance checks
- Automated database migration rollback
- Deployment approval gates (manual confirmation before prod)

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- **tech-stack-foundation-core** (this repo): Codebase must be deployment-ready
- **docker-compose-orchestration**: Existing Docker Compose setup must work correctly
- **tech-stack-production-infra**: VPS must be accessible and Docker installed

### External Dependencies
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD runtime environment
- **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**: Docker image storage (free for public repos)
- **Hetzner VPS**: Deployment target (SSH access required)
- **Docker + Docker Compose**: Installed on VPS
- **Caddy**: Running on VPS for reverse proxy (configured in docker-compose.prod.yml)

### Blockers
- VPS SSH access must be configured (SSH key pair generated)
- GitHub Secrets must be created manually (VPS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY, VPS_HOST, VPS_USER)
- Docker Compose file must be present on VPS at expected path
- GHCR must be enabled for repository (automatic for public repos)

## Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
1. VPS is accessible via SSH on standard port (22) or configured port
2. Docker and Docker Compose are installed on VPS (verified: Docker 20+, Compose v2)
3. VPS has sufficient resources for Docker images (80GB disk, 4GB RAM minimum)
4. GitHub Actions runner has network access to VPS (no firewall blocking)
5. GHCR authentication works with `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no manual PAT needed)
6. Existing Dockerfile builds successfully in CI (same as local)
7. `docker-compose.prod.yml` is configured correctly for production

### Process Assumptions
1. Only one person (Marcus) deploys to production (no concurrent deployment conflicts)
2. Main branch is protected (requires PR approval before merge)
3. Developers test locally before pushing (CI is last line of defense, not first)
4. Failed deployments are investigated immediately (no "deploy and hope")
5. Rollback is acceptable recovery method (no requirement for instant fixes)

### Risk Assumptions
1. VPS downtime during deployment is acceptable (<30 seconds)
2. Docker image size (<500MB) is acceptable for network transfer time
3. Single VPS failure requires manual recovery (disaster recovery out of scope)
4. GitHub Actions service reliability is acceptable (no self-hosted runners needed)

## Deployment Considerations

### Platform Dependencies
**VPS Configuration**:
- Docker Engine 20+ installed
- Docker Compose v2 installed
- Caddy reverse proxy running (from docker-compose.prod.yml)
- SSH server accessible on port 22 (or configured port)
- Firewall allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic (ports 80, 443)

**GitHub Configuration**:
- Repository is public or GHCR is enabled for private repos
- Actions are enabled for repository
- Branch protection rules configured on main branch

### Environment Variables
**New GitHub Secrets Required**:
- `VPS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for SSH authentication (RSA or Ed25519)
- `VPS_HOST`: VPS hostname or IP (e.g., `hetzner` or `<IP-ADDRESS>`)
- `VPS_USER`: SSH username (e.g., `marcus`)
- `VPS_DEPLOY_PATH`: Path to docker-compose.prod.yml (e.g., `/home/marcus/marcusgoll`)
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` or `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`: Notification webhook (optional)

**Build-time Environment Variables** (baked into Docker image):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: Production URL (https://test.marcusgoll.com)
- `NODE_ENV`: Always "production" for builds

**Runtime Environment Variables** (passed via .env.production on VPS):
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (Supabase)
- `GHOST_API_URL`: Ghost CMS API endpoint
- `GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY`: Ghost Content API key
- Managed separately from CI/CD pipeline (already on VPS)

### Breaking Changes
**None**: CI/CD automation does not change existing application behavior

**Deployment Process Change**:
- **Before**: Manual deployment via Dokploy webhook or SSH
- **After**: Automatic deployment on push to main
- **Rollback**: If automation fails, can revert to manual deployment temporarily

### Migration Required
**One-time Setup Tasks**:
1. Generate SSH key pair for GitHub Actions (if not exists)
2. Add public key to VPS `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
3. Add private key to GitHub Secrets as `VPS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
4. Configure VPS hostname/IP in GitHub Secrets
5. Test SSH connection from local machine first
6. Create Slack/Discord webhook (if notifications desired)
7. Update `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` with deployment automation

**No Database Migration**: CI/CD pipeline does not touch database schema

### Rollback Considerations
**Pipeline Rollback**:
- If pipeline fails, previous deployment remains active (no change)
- If health check fails, automatic rollback to previous Docker image tag
- If rollback fails, manual SSH intervention required

**Manual Rollback Procedure** (if automation fails):
```bash
ssh hetzner
cd /home/marcus/marcusgoll
docker images ghcr.io/marcusgoll/marcusgoll # Find previous tag
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull # Or specify tag
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --force-recreate nextjs
```

**Rollback Time**: <5 minutes (automatic or manual)

## Context Strategy

### Clarification Needed
> **INTENTIONALLY EMPTY**: No critical ambiguities - specification is clear for implementation

All deployment details are documented in existing project docs:
- Tech stack defined in `docs/project/tech-stack.md`
- Deployment strategy in `docs/project/deployment-strategy.md`
- Infrastructure details in `docker-compose.prod.yml` and `Dockerfile`
- VPS access via `ssh hetzner` (documented in CLAUDE.md)

### Key Design Decisions

**Decision 1: Extend Existing Workflow vs Create New**
- **Choice**: Extend `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`
- **Rationale**: Basic structure exists, just needs deployment automation added
- **Alternative Rejected**: Creating new workflow would duplicate PR validation logic
- **Impact**: Faster implementation, maintains existing PR checks

**Decision 2: Docker Registry Choice**
- **Choice**: GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) at `ghcr.io`
- **Rationale**: Free for public repos, native GitHub integration, automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN` auth
- **Alternative Rejected**: Docker Hub requires separate account and manual PAT management
- **Impact**: Simpler auth, tighter GitHub integration

**Decision 3: Deployment Method**
- **Choice**: SSH-based deployment via `appleboy/ssh-action`
- **Rationale**: Direct control, works with existing VPS setup, no additional tooling
- **Alternative Rejected**: Webhook-based (Dokploy) lacks GitHub Actions integration
- **Impact**: Full CI/CD control, easier debugging

**Decision 4: Rollback Strategy**
- **Choice**: Docker image tag-based rollback (redeploy previous tag)
- **Rationale**: Fast, reliable, leverages existing Docker Compose setup
- **Alternative Rejected**: Git revert + rebuild (slower, requires full pipeline rerun)
- **Impact**: Sub-2-minute rollback, no rebuild needed

**Decision 5: Notification Channel**
- **Choice**: Slack OR Discord webhook (user choice)
- **Rationale**: Most developers use one or both, webhook is simple
- **Alternative Rejected**: Email (slower, less actionable), SMS (costly)
- **Impact**: Real-time notifications, mobile-friendly

2. Verify response matches health check expectations
3. Check workflow logs show health check passed

### AC-005: Secrets Are Secure
**Given** sensitive credentials are needed for deployment
**When** workflow runs
**Then** VPS SSH key is loaded from GitHub Secrets
**And** Secrets are never logged in workflow output

**And** Build time is 50%+ faster than first (cold cache) run

**Validation**:
1. Run pipeline, note build duration (cold cache)
2. Run pipeline again without changing dependencies
3. Compare build times, verify 50%+ improvement

### AC-009: Pipeline Completes Under 10 Minutes
**Given** code is pushed to main
**When** full pipeline runs (build, push, deploy, health check)
**Then** Total duration is under 10 minutes
**And** Each step logs progress clearly

**Validation**:
1. Push code to main
2. Monitor full pipeline execution
3. Verify completion time under 10 minutes
4. Review step-by-step timings in workflow logs

## Success Criteria

### User-Facing Success Criteria
