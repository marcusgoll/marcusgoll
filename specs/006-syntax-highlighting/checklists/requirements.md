# Specification Quality Checklist: Syntax Highlighting Enhancements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: specs/006-syntax-highlighting/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - Note: Shiki mentioned as solution choice per GitHub issue, not as hard constraint
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders (user scenarios clear)
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (0 total)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable (10 criteria with specific targets)
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on outcomes, not tools)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined (7 primary scenarios)
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified (5 edge cases documented)
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded (Out of Scope section comprehensive)
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified (Feature 005 blocker with mitigation)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (12 FR items)
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows (dark/light theme, line highlighting, accessibility)
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification (requirements focus on "what", not "how")

## Notes

- ✅ All checklist items passed
- ✅ 0 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all requirements clear)
- ✅ GitHub Issue context integrated (ICE score, dependencies, requirements)
- ✅ Hypothesis defined with predicted 40% engagement improvement
- ⚠️ Feature 005 dependency noted but mitigated with CSS fallback strategy
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained (no breaking changes)
