## Cross-Artifact Consistency Analysis

### Spec.md ↔ Plan.md Alignment

**Architecture Decisions**: ✅ Consistent
- Spec specifies Shiki upgrade → Plan implements custom rehype plugin
- Spec requires dual theme support → Plan implements CSS media query strategy
- Spec requires build-time highlighting → Plan uses rehype-shiki.ts plugin

**Reuse Patterns**: ✅ Correct
- Plan identifies 5 existing components to reuse (CodeBlock, MDX components, globals.css, next.config.ts, package.json)
- Plan proposes 3 new components (rehype-shiki.ts, shiki-config.ts, enhanced CSS)
- All reuse decisions trace back to spec requirements

**Breaking Changes**: ✅ None
- Spec.md:227 explicitly states "No breaking changes"
- Plan.md:249 confirms backward compatibility
- Existing CodeBlock API unchanged

### Plan.md ↔ Tasks.md Alignment

**Task Completeness**: ⚠️ Mostly Complete (2 missing)
- All MVP user stories (US1-US6) have corresponding tasks
- P3 stories (US7, US8) mentioned in plan.md:446-457 but no tasks created
- This appears intentional (MVP scope excludes P3), but not explicitly stated

**Dependency Order**: ✅ Correct
- Tasks follow dependency graph: Setup → US1 → US2 → US3 → US4-US6 → Polish
- Parallel execution opportunities correctly identified (tasks.md:L29-34)
- TDD approach included (T004, T005, T011 are test tasks)

**Architecture Implementation**: ✅ Consistent
- T003: shiki-config.ts → Implements plan.md:207-220
- T006: rehype-shiki.ts → Implements plan.md:190-206
- T008-T009: Theme CSS → Implements plan.md:134-149
- T010-T013: Line highlighting → Implements plan.md:160-212

### Spec.md ↔ Tasks.md Alignment

**User Story Coverage**: ⚠️ 75% Complete
- US1-US6 (P1-P2): All have tasks ✅
- US7-US8 (P3): No tasks ❌
- Spec.md:145 mentions "Ship US1-US3 first" as MVP, so US7-US8 omission may be intentional

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage**: ✅ All P1-P2 Stories
- US1 acceptance: T003-T007 cover Shiki installation, language support, build-time highlighting
- US2 acceptance: T008-T009 cover dual themes and auto-switching
- US3 acceptance: T010-T013 cover metadata parsing and line highlighting
- US4 acceptance: T014-T016 cover keyboard nav and ARIA labels
- US5 acceptance: T017-T018 cover inline code styling
- US6 acceptance: T019 covers aviation code testing

---

## Constitution Alignment

**From constitution.md MUST principles:**

✅ **Specification First** (Line 504): Spec created before implementation, all requirements defined
✅ **Testing Standards** (Line 522): Unit tests (T004, T005, T011), integration tests (T022), E2E (T027)
✅ **Performance Requirements** (Line 543): NFR-001 defines <5s build time, T025 benchmarks
✅ **Accessibility (a11y)** (Line 563): WCAG 2.1 AA required in NFR-002, validated in T012, T027
✅ **Security Practices** (Line 582): Input validation in T021 (sanitize metadata)
✅ **Code Quality** (Line 602): Reuse existing patterns, DRY principle applied
✅ **Documentation Standards** (Line 623): NOTES.md tracking in T023
✅ **Do Not Overengineer** (Line 642): Simplest solution (Shiki library vs custom parser)

**Brand Principles Alignment:**
✅ **Systematic Clarity** (Line 379): Teaching-focused code examples (aviation use cases in US6)
✅ **Visual Brand Consistency** (Line 401): WCAG AA contrast requirements aligned with brand accessibility standards
✅ **Multi-Passionate Integration** (Line 421): Aviation code examples (US6) integrate aviation + dev domains

**No constitution violations detected**

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

1. **Build-time performance** (MEDIUM risk, mitigated)
   - Concern: 100+ code blocks could slow build
   - Mitigation: T025 benchmarks with 100 blocks, target <5s
   - Fallback: Optimize with parallel processing if needed

2. **Bundle size impact** (LOW risk, mitigated)
   - Concern: Shiki could increase client bundle
   - Mitigation: Build-time rendering, T026 measures impact
   - Expected: <10KB increase (mostly CSS)

3. **Theme switching compatibility** (LOW risk, mitigated)
   - Concern: CSS media query browser support
   - Mitigation: prefers-color-scheme supported in 95%+ browsers
   - Fallback: Default to dark theme if unsupported

4. **Accessibility regressions** (MEDIUM risk, mitigated)
   - Concern: Shiki output may not be screen-reader friendly
   - Mitigation: T015, T016 add ARIA labels manually, T027 validates with Lighthouse
   - Quality gate: Accessibility score must remain ≥95

### Dependency Risks

1. **Feature 005 blocker** (MITIGATED)
   - Blocker: Feature 005 (Dark/Light Mode Toggle) not started
   - Mitigation: CSS prefers-color-scheme fallback in US2
   - Enhancement path: Upgrade to JS-based toggle when Feature 005 ships

2. **External library maintenance** (LOW risk)
   - Dependency: Shiki library
   - Risk: Abandoned or breaking changes
   - Mitigation: Maintained by VS Code team, active development, stable API

---

## Breaking Change Detection

**Analysis**: No breaking changes detected ✅

**Evidence**:
- Spec.md:227-231: "No breaking changes" explicitly stated
- Existing code blocks continue to work without modification
- CodeBlock component API unchanged (same props)
- MDX files require no modifications
- Rollback: Standard 3-command Vercel alias change (no data loss risk)

**Migration Requirements**: None (automatic upgrade via build process)

---

## Next Actions

**✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

Next: `/implement`

### Implementation Plan

/implement will:
1. Execute tasks from tasks.md (27 tasks in 8 phases)
2. Follow TDD where applicable (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
3. Execute parallel tasks concurrently where possible (15 opportunities identified)
4. Commit after each task completion
5. Update NOTES.md with decisions and blockers
6. Track errors in error-log.md

**Estimated Duration**: 12-16 hours (2 days)

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-4 (US1-US3: Shiki upgrade, themes, line highlighting)

**Post-MVP Enhancements**: Phases 5-7 (US4-US6: keyboard shortcuts, inline code, aviation testing)

### Recommendations for US7 and US8

**Option A**: Mark as out-of-scope for this feature (recommended)
- Add to roadmap as future enhancements
- Focus MVP on core functionality (US1-US6)
- Ship and validate before adding P3 features

**Option B**: Add tasks for US7 and US8
- Create tasks for copy button hover effects (US7)
- Create tasks for collapsible code blocks >50 lines (US8)
- Extend implementation timeline by ~8 hours

**Recommendation**: Choose Option A (mark out-of-scope, ship MVP first)

---

## Remediation Suggestions

### C1: US7 and US8 Missing Tasks

**Issue**: P3 user stories (US7, US8) have no corresponding tasks in tasks.md

**Root Cause**: MVP strategy (spec.md:145) focuses on US1-US3, but US4-US6 were added. US7-US8 intentionally excluded but not explicitly marked.

**Suggested Fix**:
1. Update tasks.md to add Phase 9 section:
   ```markdown
   ## Phase 9: Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)

   **US7 [P3]** - Copy button placement improvements
   - Status: Deferred to future enhancement
   - Rationale: MVP focuses on core functionality, existing copy button works

   **US8 [P3]** - Collapsible code blocks
   - Status: Deferred to future enhancement
   - Rationale: MVP focuses on syntax quality and themes, not block size management
   ```

2. OR add to roadmap as separate features:
   - Feature 007: Code Block UX Enhancements (US7, US8)

**Effort**: 5 minutes (documentation update)

### C2: Terminology Drift

**Issue**: "rehypeShiki" vs "rehype-shiki" used inconsistently

**Root Cause**: File names use kebab-case, function names use camelCase

**Suggested Fix**: Add clarification to plan.md or tasks.md:
```markdown
**Naming Convention**:
- File: `lib/rehype-shiki.ts` (kebab-case per CLAUDE.md)
- Export: `rehypeShiki` function (camelCase per JavaScript convention)
- Import: `import rehypeShiki from 'lib/rehype-shiki'`
```

**Effort**: 2 minutes (documentation clarification)

### A1: Analytics Tracking Ambiguity

**Issue**: Spec.md:145 mentions "based on usage metrics" but no analytics events specified

**Root Cause**: Hypothesis defines metrics (time-on-page, copy button usage) but implementation not specified

**Suggested Fix**: Add to NOTES.md during implementation:
```markdown
**Analytics Tracking** (Post-MVP):
- Track copy button clicks: Event "code_copied" with properties {language, lineCount}
- Track time-on-page for code-heavy posts (identify by >5 code blocks)
- Baseline measurement period: 2 weeks post-US1 deployment
- Compare to hypothesis prediction (+40% engagement)
```

**Effort**: Post-implementation (not blocking)

---

## Validation Methodology

**Tools Used**:
- Manual cross-reference of spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md
- grep analysis for requirement/task coverage
- Constitution.md principle alignment check
- Breaking change detection via spec deployment section
- Dependency graph validation

**Limitations**:
- No automated AST parsing (manual review)
- No code analysis (pre-implementation phase)
- Constitution validation limited to documented MUST principles

**Confidence**: High (comprehensive manual review completed)
