# Preview Testing Findings: Homepage Redesign

**Date**: 2025-10-29 18:38 UTC
**Tester**: Claude Code + User
**Environment**: Local dev server (http://localhost:3000)

---

## Executive Summary

**Finding**: Homepage displays OLD design, not the redesigned version with navy palette.

**Root Cause**: Phase 4 (Implementation) was verification-based, not full integration.
- ✅ lib/constants.ts created with configuration
- ✅ Components verified to exist (90.9% reuse)
- ❌ Components NOT updated to use navy/emerald brand colors
- ❌ Hero NOT updated to use new constants

**Current State**:
- Homepage uses generic tokens: `bg-dark-bg`, `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`
- Brand colors ARE available (used on /about, /aviation, /contact, /dev-startup pages)
- Just not applied to homepage yet

---

## Detailed Findings

### What WAS Created
1. **lib/constants.ts** (111 lines) ✅
   - Site branding (tagline, headlines)
   - Content tracks enum
   - Active project config (CFIPros.com)
   - Homepage configuration
   - Newsletter config
   - Analytics events
   - Performance budgets

2. **Brand Colors Available** ✅
   - Navy classes work: `bg-navy-950`, `text-navy-900`
   - Emerald classes work: `text-emerald-400`, `bg-emerald-600`
   - Already used on other pages successfully

### What is NOT Applied

1. **Homepage Hero Section** ❌
   - Current: `bg-dark-bg` (generic)
   - Expected: `bg-navy-950` or `bg-navy-900` (brand)
   - Current: `text-foreground` (generic)
   - Expected: `text-white` or specific navy shades

2. **Interactive Elements** ❌
   - Current: Generic button styles
   - Expected: `bg-emerald-600` CTAs

3. **Component Integration** ❌
   - Hero doesn't import from lib/constants.ts
   - Components don't use HERO_HEADLINE, HERO_SUBHEADLINE
   - ACTIVE_PROJECT not rendered
   - CONTENT_TRACKS not referenced in filters

---

## Impact Assessment

**Severity**: HIGH (visual changes are primary feature goal)

**Blocking**: Depends on interpretation:
- If goal: "Create constants + verify architecture" → ✅ COMPLETE
- If goal: "Apply navy palette to homepage" → ❌ INCOMPLETE

---

## Options

### Option A: Complete Integration Now ⏰ Est. 2-3 hours

**Scope**:
1. Update components/home/Hero.tsx:
   - Change `bg-dark-bg` → `bg-navy-950`
   - Import and use HERO_HEADLINE, HERO_SUBHEADLINE from lib/constants.ts
   - Update CTA button to use `bg-emerald-600`

2. Update components/home/HomePageClient.tsx:
   - Use CONTENT_TRACKS from lib/constants.ts
   - Render ACTIVE_PROJECT if status === "active"

3. Test and verify visual changes

**Pros**: Feature fully complete, matches spec
**Cons**: Delays deployment by 2-3 hours

### Option B: Document and Ship (Current State) ⏰ Est. 15 minutes

**Scope**:
1. Update spec.md to clarify actual delivered scope
2. Document visual integration as follow-up task
3. Create GitHub issue for visual integration work
4. Proceed to staging deployment with current state

**Pros**: Ship infrastructure changes now, visual changes later
**Cons**: Doesn't deliver visual redesign (primary goal)

### Option C: Abort and Re-implement ⏰ Est. 4-5 hours

**Scope**:
1. Run `/debug` to fix implementation gaps
2. Re-run `/implement` with explicit file modification tasks
3. Re-run `/optimize` after changes
4. Return to `/preview` for validation

**Pros**: Proper end-to-end implementation
**Cons**: Significant time investment

## Recommendation

**Recommended**: **Option A - Complete Integration Now**

**Rationale**:
- Spec.md clearly states: "Modernize visual design with brand tokens"
- Primary goal is visual redesign, not just constants creation
- Brand colors already available and working (low risk)
- 2-3 hour investment completes feature properly
- Avoids confusion about "what shipped" vs "what's pending"

**Next Steps if Option A**:
1. Run `/implement` with specific integration tasks
2. Focus on Hero.tsx and HomePageClient.tsx only
3. Apply navy palette: bg-navy-950, emerald CTAs
4. Re-run `/preview` to verify
5. Then continue to /ship-staging
