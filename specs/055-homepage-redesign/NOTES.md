**Primary Goal**: Transform homepage from outdated, single-column layout to modern, brand-aligned design that effectively surfaces dual-track content and converts visitors to newsletter subscribers.

**Key Success Metrics**:
- Newsletter signup conversion: 2% → >5% (+150% increase)
- Bounce rate: 55% → <45% (-18% reduction)
- Homepage → blog CTR: 20% → >35% (+75% increase)

## Research Findings

### Brand Identity & Visual System

**Source**: `docs/VISUAL_BRAND_GUIDE.md`, `docs/MARCUS_BRAND_PROFILE.md`, `.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md`

**Key Findings**:
1. **Color Palette**:
   - Primary: Navy 900 `#0F172A` (backgrounds, headers, primary CTAs)
   - Secondary: Emerald 600 `#059669` (accents, links, success states)
   - Recently implemented: Navy background palette for brand consistency
   - Aviation accent: Sky Blue `#0EA5E9`
   - Dev/Startup accent: Orange `#F97316`

2. **Typography**:
   - Primary font: Work Sans (400, 500, 600, 700)
   - Code font: JetBrains Mono
   - Headings: Navy 900, Weight 600-700
   - Body: Slate 800, 16px, Line height 1.7

3. **Brand Essence**: "Systematic Mastery"
   - Sage Explorer archetype (60% structured teaching, 40% authentic transparency)
   - Visual design must reflect aviation's systematic discipline
   - Clear information hierarchy crucial

4. **Dual-Track Content Strategy**:
   - 40% Aviation content (pilots, CFIs, career guidance)
   - 40% Dev/Startup content (building in public, systematic development)
   - 20% Cross-pollination (aviation principles → dev)

**Decision**: Apply navy background palette consistently, use emerald for interactive elements, implement clear visual separation for content tracks (subtle sky blue tint for aviation, subtle emerald for dev tags).

### Current Homepage Analysis

**Source**: `app/page.tsx`, `components/home/Hero.tsx`, `components/home/HomePageClient.tsx`

**Current State**:
- M2 Design implemented (Sidebar + Magazine Masonry layout)
- Hero section exists but needs brand token application
- Magazine masonry layout with CSS columns
- Track filtering implemented (sidebar with post counts)
- Featured post hero treatment
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Schema.org markup (Website, Organization)

**What Works**:
- Track filtering UX (sidebar approach with counts)
- Featured post concept
- Semantic HTML structure
- Analytics integration (PageViewTracker)
- ISR with 60-second revalidation

**What Needs Improvement**:
- Visual design doesn't fully reflect brand identity (navy palette)
- Hero section needs stronger value proposition
- Newsletter CTA not prominent enough
- "What I'm building" section missing
- Mobile navigation could be enhanced
- Visual hierarchy could be clearer

**Decision**: Enhance existing M2 layout with brand tokens rather than complete rebuild. Focus on visual polish, hero improvement, and strategic section additions.

### Content Discovery Patterns

**Source**: Design best practices, current implementation patterns

**Findings**:
1. **Filter Patterns**:
   - Current: Sidebar with filter buttons + post counts (good pattern)
   - Enhancement opportunity: Mobile-first filter bar above content
   - URL parameter support for shareable filtered views (partially implemented)

2. **Featured Content**:
   - Current: Featured post hero treatment exists
   - Best practice: 1-3 featured posts with larger cards
   - Manual curation via Ghost CMS (featured flag or specific tag)

3. **Grid Layouts**:
   - Current: Magazine masonry with CSS columns
   - Best practice: CSS Grid for better responsive control
   - Recommendation: 1 column mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop

4. **Newsletter CTAs**:
   - Best practice: Multiple touchpoints (hero, sticky sidebar, footer)
   - Current: Limited visibility
   - Recommendation: Prominent hero CTA + sidebar form

**Decision**: Keep existing filter sidebar concept, enhance with mobile improvements. Add newsletter CTA to hero and sidebar. Implement featured posts section before recent posts grid.

### Performance Considerations

**Source**: `.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md`, Lighthouse performance budgets

**Requirements**:
- FCP <1.5s, TTI <3.5s, CLS <0.15, LCP <2.5s
- Lighthouse Performance ≥85, Accessibility ≥95
- Total page weight <2MB, JS bundle <500KB, CSS <100KB

**Current Status** (baseline measurements needed):
- Page uses ISR with 60-second revalidation (good for performance)
- Images need lazy loading optimization
- Magazine masonry uses CSS columns (performant)

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Lazy load post thumbnails below fold
- Optimize hero section images (WebP with JPG fallback)
- Defer non-critical CSS
- Use intersection observer for scroll animations
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion

**Decision**: Implement lazy loading for post images, optimize hero assets, measure baseline before/after redesign for performance regression detection.

### Accessibility Requirements

**Source**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards, `.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md`

**Requirements**:
- Color contrast ≥4.5:1 for text, ≥3:1 for UI components
- Keyboard navigation support (no mouse-only interactions)
- Screen reader compatibility (semantic HTML, ARIA labels)
- Focus states visible
- Touch targets ≥44x44px

**Current Implementation**:
- Keyboard shortcuts exist (good)
- Semantic HTML structure (good)
- Schema.org markup (good)

**Enhancement Needs**:
- Verify color contrast with navy background palette
- Ensure filter buttons have clear focus states
- Mobile menu needs focus trap and keyboard close (Esc)
- Newsletter form needs proper labels and error announcements

**Decision**: Conduct full accessibility audit during optimization phase, ensure navy palette meets contrast requirements, implement keyboard navigation for mobile menu.

## System Components Analysis

**Reusable (to be verified in planning phase)**:
- Hero component (exists, needs brand token enhancement)
- Button component (primary, secondary, outline variants)
- PostCard component (thumbnail, title, excerpt, metadata)
- Badge/Tag component (Aviation, Dev/Startup track indicators)
- Newsletter form component (may need creation)
- Mobile navigation menu component (enhancement of existing)

**New Components Needed**:
- FeaturedPostCard component (larger card treatment for featured posts)
- ProjectCard component ("What I'm building" section)
- FilterBar component (mobile-first filter UI, may be enhancement of existing sidebar)

**Integration Points**:
- Ghost Content API (existing, no changes)
- Analytics (PostHog + structured logs, existing)
- Newsletter API (ConvertKit/Mailchimp, existing integration)

**Rationale**: System-first approach reduces implementation time and ensures consistency. Component inventory check during planning phase will identify exact reuse vs. new component requirements.

## Key Decisions

### Design Direction
1. **Enhance M2 Layout vs. Complete Rebuild**: Decided to enhance existing M2 layout (sidebar + magazine masonry) with brand tokens rather than complete rebuild. Rationale: Current structure works well, focus effort on visual polish and strategic additions.

2. **Hero Section Strategy**: Implement clear value proposition with dual-track messaging ("Teaching systematic thinking from 30,000 feet. Aviation career guidance + software development insights."). Primary CTA: "Read Latest" or "Subscribe to Newsletter".

3. **Content Track Filtering**: Keep existing sidebar filter concept for desktop, add mobile-first filter bar for <768px viewports. URL parameter support for shareable filtered views.

4. **Featured Content Approach**: Manual curation via Ghost CMS (featured flag or specific "featured" tag). Display 1-3 featured posts with larger card treatment before recent posts grid.

5. **Newsletter CTA Placement**: Multiple touchpoints - prominent CTA in hero section + sticky sidebar form (desktop) or inline section (mobile). Track conversion by source (hero vs. sidebar).

### Technical Decisions
1. **Performance Budget**: Maintain FCP <1.5s, LCP <2.5s through lazy loading images, optimizing hero assets, and deferring non-critical resources.

2. **Responsive Breakpoints**: 320px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop), 1280px (wide). Use CSS Grid for post layout (1 col mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop).

3. **Accessibility Approach**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory. Verify navy palette contrast ratios, implement keyboard navigation, ensure screen reader compatibility.

4. **Analytics Instrumentation**: Dual tracking (PostHog dashboards + structured logs for Claude measurement). Track: page views, filter clicks, post clicks, newsletter signups, project card clicks, errors.

5. **A/B Test Strategy**: Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%) over 15 days. Primary metric: newsletter signup conversion 2% → >5%. Kill switch: error rate >5% OR LCP >4s OR newsletter signups <1.5%.

### Content Decisions
1. **Hero Copy**: "Teaching systematic thinking from 30,000 feet" (tagline). Value proposition emphasizes dual expertise (pilot + teacher + developer).

2. **Track Naming**: "Aviation" and "Dev/Startup" (not "Aviation" and "Development" to emphasize building-in-public startup angle).

3. **Project Card Content**: Display CFIPros.com as active project. Status indicator (green "Active"), tagline, CTA to visit project. Only show when status is "active".

4. **Newsletter Form Copy**: Clear value proposition ("Get systematic thinking insights delivered weekly"). GDPR-compliant privacy policy link.

### Out of Scope (Phase 1)
- Blog post page redesign (separate feature)
- About page update (separate feature)
- Dark mode implementation (future enhancement)
- Advanced animations (Phase 3 polish only if time permits)
- Search functionality (separate feature)
- Related posts recommendations (separate feature)

## Assumptions

1. **Ghost CMS Data Structure**: Assumes posts have `tags` array with "aviation" or "dev-startup" values, `featured` boolean flag, and standard Ghost metadata (published_at, reading_time, feature_image).

2. **Newsletter Integration**: Assumes existing newsletter integration (ConvertKit/Mailchimp) has API endpoint for subscriptions. Newsletter form will use existing backend endpoint.

3. **Analytics Setup**: Assumes PostHog and structured logging infrastructure exists and is functioning. New events will be added to existing tracking.

4. **Brand Assets**: Assumes brand color tokens (navy palette) are defined in Tailwind config or CSS variables. Hero section images/graphics exist or can be created during implementation.

5. **Content Availability**: Assumes Ghost CMS has sufficient posts tagged with "aviation" and "dev-startup" for meaningful filtering. Assumes at least 1 featured post exists for featured section.

6. **Browser Support**: Targets latest 2 versions of modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) + iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Android. No IE11 support.

7. **Performance Baseline**: Assumes current homepage meets minimum performance thresholds. Redesign must not regress performance metrics.

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Risk**: Layout shifts during image loading cause CLS violations
   - **Mitigation**: Use aspect ratio containers, implement lazy loading with proper placeholders, measure CLS during optimization phase

2. **Risk**: Filter state management causes re-renders or performance issues
   - **Mitigation**: Use React memo, optimize filter logic, implement debouncing if needed, profile during implementation

3. **Risk**: Mobile navigation menu causes focus trap or keyboard navigation issues
   - **Mitigation**: Follow accessibility best practices, test with keyboard and screen readers, implement proper focus management

### UX Risks
1. **Risk**: Track filtering confuses visitors (not immediately clear what "Aviation" vs "Dev/Startup" means)
   - **Mitigation**: Add tooltips or brief descriptions, track filter usage analytics, A/B test filter naming

2. **Risk**: Newsletter CTA is too aggressive or intrusive
   - **Mitigation**: Use non-modal approach (inline forms, not popups), track dismissal rates, A/B test CTA placement

3. **Risk**: Featured posts section competes with recent posts for attention
   - **Mitigation**: Clear visual distinction (larger cards, different background), limit to 1-3 featured posts, user test hierarchy

### Content Risks
1. **Risk**: Insufficient posts in one content track leads to empty filter states
   - **Mitigation**: Display "No posts found" message with CTA to view all posts, ensure both tracks have minimum 3-5 posts before launch

2. **Risk**: Project card becomes stale if CFIPros.com status changes
   - **Mitigation**: Implement simple status toggle in CMS or config, hide card if status is not "active"

### Performance Risks
1. **Risk**: Adding multiple sections increases page weight beyond 2MB budget
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize images (WebP), lazy load below-fold content, measure total page weight during optimization

2. **Risk**: Navy background palette causes contrast issues with existing text colors
   - **Mitigation**: Audit all text/background combinations, adjust colors if needed, run automated contrast checks
