## Findings

### Critical Issues (0)

None found. ✅

### High Issues (0)

None found. ✅

### Medium Issues (2)

| ID | Category | Location | Issue | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------|----------------|
| M1 | Terminology | spec.md, plan.md | Inconsistent entity naming: "Ghost CMS" vs "MDX files" | **Context**: Spec mentions "Ghost CMS" (lines 20, 68, 233) but plan.md uses "MDX files" (line 48) as content source. **Impact**: Implementation confusion about data source. **Fix**: Clarify in plan.md that content source is MDX files (not Ghost CMS), or update spec if Ghost CMS is actual source. |
| M2 | Coverage | tasks.md | Mobile navigation (US7 [P3]) and scroll animations (US8 [P3]) deferred but edge case references mobile menu | **Context**: Spec edge case #4 asks "How does layout adapt on screens between mobile and desktop breakpoints?" but US7 (mobile nav) is P3/deferred. **Impact**: Edge case partially unaddressed in MVP. **Fix**: Either add mobile responsive testing task to MVP or clarify edge case applies to P3 only. |

### Low Issues (3)

| ID | Category | Location | Issue | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------|----------------|
| L1 | Consistency | spec.md L68 | "Ghost CMS (featured flag or specific tag)" - Implementation detail in spec | Spec should say "manually curated" without implementation details. Plan correctly abstracts this (plan.md L286). Not blocking - plan is correct. |
| L2 | Optimization | tasks.md | No explicit task for verifying brand color contrast ratios | **Context**: NFR-002 requires ≥4.5:1 contrast, T007 says "Verify" but no standalone task. **Impact**: Minor - covered by T011 (hero accessibility). **Suggestion**: Could add explicit color contrast validation task or accept coverage in T011. |
| L3 | Documentation | NOTES.md | NOTES.md checkpoint for Phase 2 (Tasks) doesn't mention deferred P3 stories | **Context**: US7 and US8 are P3/deferred but not explicitly called out in NOTES checkpoint. **Impact**: None - tasks.md clearly marks them. **Suggestion**: Update NOTES if desired for completeness. |

## Consistency Validation

### Spec ↔ Plan Alignment

✅ **Architecture matches spec**:
- Spec: UI-only feature, no API changes, no database migrations
- Plan: Confirms UI-only, 100% API reuse, no schema changes
- **Status**: Aligned

✅ **Performance targets consistent**:
- Spec NFR-001: FCP <1.5s, LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.15
- Plan NFR-001: Same targets
- **Status**: Aligned

✅ **Component inventory matches**:
- Spec mentions: Hero, filter buttons, post cards, newsletter form
- Plan identifies: 10 existing components, 1 new (ProjectCard)
- **Status**: Aligned

⚠️ **Minor inconsistency** (M1):
- Spec references "Ghost CMS" as content source
- Plan uses "MDX files" as content source
- **Impact**: Low (likely plan is correct, Ghost CMS reference may be outdated)

### Plan ↔ Tasks Alignment

✅ **Task count matches plan estimate**:
- Plan mentions: 28 tasks expected
- Tasks.md: 28 tasks delivered
- **Status**: Perfect match

✅ **Component creation tasks**:
- Plan NEW section lists: ProjectCard (1 new component)
- Tasks.md: T022 creates ProjectCard
- **Status**: Aligned

✅ **Dependency order**:
- Plan dependency graph: Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → US3 → US4-6
- Tasks phases: Match plan sequence exactly
- **Status**: Aligned

✅ **Parallel execution opportunities**:
- Plan: Suggests parallel tasks
- Tasks.md: 6 tasks marked [P]
- **Status**: Aligned

### Cross-Artifact Terminology

✅ **Consistent naming**:
- "Hero section" (not "Hero component", "Hero banner", variants)
- "Content track filtering" (not "Tag filtering", "Category filtering")
- "Recent posts grid" (not "Post list", "Blog grid")
- "Newsletter signup" (not "Email capture", "Subscription form")

⚠️ **Content source inconsistency** (M1 - already flagged)

---

## Anti-Duplication Validation

✅ **No duplicate requirements**:
- Ran similarity check on 12 functional requirements
- No pairs with >60% keyword overlap
- Each requirement addresses distinct functionality

✅ **No duplicate tasks**:
- Checked 28 tasks for redundancy
- No tasks implementing same functionality
- Clear separation of concerns (e.g., T007 applies brand palette, T008 updates copy)

✅ **Component reuse maximized**:
- 10 existing components identified for reuse
- Only 1 new component needed (ProjectCard)
- Reuse ratio: 90.9%
- **Rationale**: Plan correctly identifies existing Hero, PostFeedFilter, PostCard, PostGrid, FeaturedPostsSection, NewsletterSignupForm, Button, Container, Dialog, TrackBadge

---

## Breaking Changes Analysis

✅ **Zero breaking changes confirmed**:
- **API contracts**: No changes (reuses existing `/api/newsletter/subscribe`)
- **Database schema**: No migrations (UI-only)
- **Auth flow**: No changes (public homepage)
- **Client compatibility**: Backward compatible (progressive enhancement)
- **Deployment**: No new environment variables
- **Rollback**: Fully reversible via git revert

**Risk Level**: LOW ✅

---

## Security & Performance

### Security

✅ **Input validation**:
- Newsletter form: Zod schema validation (plan.md L316)
- Filter params: Enum validation ('all' | 'aviation' | 'dev-startup')
- No user-generated content rendering

✅ **Data protection**:
- Email addresses: Not logged, not sent to GA4 (plan.md L333)
- TLS 1.3 in transit (plan.md L337)
- PostgreSQL encryption at rest (plan.md L336)

### Performance

✅ **Performance budget defined**:
- FCP <1.5s, LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.15
- JS bundle <500KB, CSS <100KB, total <2MB
- Lighthouse Performance ≥85, Accessibility ≥95

✅ **Optimization strategies**:
- Lazy loading images (FR-012, T006, T017)
- ISR with 60-second revalidation (plan.md L64)
- WebP images with blur placeholders (plan.md L409)

✅ **Measurement plan**:
- Lighthouse CI enforced
- Core Web Vitals tracked via GA4
- T026 validates performance budget

---

## Constitution Alignment

**Note**: No `.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md` found in codebase.

**Assumed Constitution Principles** (based on project patterns):

✅ **Performance-first**: NFR-001 defines measurable performance targets
✅ **Accessibility**: NFR-002 requires WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
✅ **Mobile-responsive**: NFR-003 supports 320px-1440px+ viewports
✅ **Semantic HTML**: NFR-005 maintains schema.org markup
✅ **Progressive enhancement**: NFR-004 ensures core content without JS
✅ **Privacy-conscious**: Plan L333 confirms no PII in logs/analytics
✅ **Reversible deployments**: Spec L297 confirms git revert rollback

**Status**: Assumed principles all addressed ✅

---

## Task Execution Readiness

### Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
✅ All prerequisites clear:
- T001: Verify brand tokens in `tailwind.config.ts`
- T002: Audit component inventory
- T003: Create project constants

**Blocking dependencies**: None
**Parallel execution**: T002, T003 can run parallel

### Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T006)
✅ Infrastructure tasks well-defined:
- T004: MDX frontmatter support
- T005: Analytics tracking
- T006: Image shimmer utility

**Blocking dependencies**: None
**Parallel execution**: All 3 can run parallel [P]

### Phase 3-5: MVP (T007-T019)
✅ Clear sequential path:
- Phase 3 (US1): Hero section (5 tasks)
- Phase 4 (US2): Content filtering (4 tasks)
- Phase 5 (US3): Recent posts grid (4 tasks)

**Blocking dependencies**: Phases sequential, tasks within phase parallelizable
**Estimated duration**: 15 hours (MVP scope)

### Phase 6-8: Enhancement (T020-T025)
✅ Independent from MVP:
- Can be implemented after MVP validation
- No blocking dependencies between US4, US5, US6
- All 6 tasks can theoretically run parallel

### Phase 9: Polish (T026-T028)
✅ Final validation tasks:
- T026: Performance budget compliance
- T027: Update NOTES.md
- T028: CI smoke test (note only)

## Recommendations

### Required Before /implement

None. Feature is ready for implementation. ✅

### Suggested Improvements (Optional)

1. **Clarify content source** (M1):
   - Update spec.md to use "MDX files" instead of "Ghost CMS" for consistency
   - OR update plan.md if Ghost CMS is actually the content source
   - **Impact**: Low (implementation will follow plan.md which is clear)

2. **Mobile responsive edge case** (M2):
   - Add note to spec.md L23 that edge case #4 is addressed in US7 (P3/deferred)
   - OR add mobile breakpoint testing task to MVP if critical
   - **Impact**: Low (US7 acceptance criteria cover this)

3. **Explicit contrast validation** (L2):
   - Consider adding standalone task "Validate all navy palette combinations meet WCAG AA"
   - OR accept coverage via T011 (hero accessibility audit)
   - **Impact**: Very low (already covered in T011)

## Next Actions

**✅ PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION**

```bash
/implement
```

### What /implement will do:

1. Execute 28 tasks sequentially by phase
2. Follow dependency graph (Setup → Foundational → MVP → Enhancement → Polish)
3. Verify component reuse (10 existing components)
4. Apply navy brand palette consistently
5. Validate performance budget at completion
6. Track progress in NOTES.md

### Estimated Timeline:

- **Phase 1-2** (Setup + Foundational): 1-2 hours
- **Phase 3-5** (MVP - US1-US3): 15 hours
- **Phase 6-8** (Enhancement - US4-US6): 12 hours
- **Phase 9** (Polish): 2 hours
- **Total**: 30-32 hours (~4 days)

### MVP-First Delivery:

Option to ship after Phase 5 (US1-US3 complete):
- Functional homepage with hero, filtering, recent posts
- 19/28 tasks (68%)
- Validate with users before implementing US4-US6
