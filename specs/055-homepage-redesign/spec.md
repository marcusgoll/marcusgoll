# Feature Specification: Homepage Redesign

**Branch**: `quick/brand-color-tokens-core-hex`
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Draft

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Story
A visitor lands on marcusgoll.com and immediately understands Marcus's dual expertise (Aviation + Dev/Startup), sees compelling content from both tracks, and can easily discover relevant posts based on their interests. The modern, polished design reflects brand quality and systematic thinking while providing clear navigation and engagement opportunities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new visitor lands on homepage, **When** they view above-the-fold content, **Then** they see a hero section with value proposition, brand identity, and primary CTA within 2 seconds
2. **Given** a visitor interested in aviation content, **When** they use content track filtering, **Then** they see only aviation-tagged posts without page reload
3. **Given** a visitor exploring the site, **When** they scroll the homepage, **Then** they encounter featured content showcase, recent posts grid, and "What I'm building" section in logical order
4. **Given** a mobile visitor, **When** they open navigation menu, **Then** they see responsive mobile menu with track filters and newsletter signup
5. **Given** a visitor wants to stay updated, **When** they see newsletter CTA, **Then** they can subscribe with email in prominent, accessible form

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Ghost CMS has no posts tagged with selected filter?
- How does system handle hero section with missing featured post data?
- What occurs when "What I'm building" project status is not "active"?
- How does layout adapt on screens between mobile and desktop breakpoints (768px-1024px)?
- What happens if newsletter signup form submission fails?

## User Stories (Prioritized)

> **Purpose**: Break down feature into independently deliverable stories for MVP-first delivery.

## Success Metrics (HEART Framework)

> **Purpose**: Define quantified success criteria using Google's HEART framework.
> **Constraint**: All metrics MUST be Claude Code-measurable (SQL, logs, Lighthouse).

| Dimension | Goal | Signal | Metric | Target | Guardrail |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Happiness** | Reduce bounce rate | Time on site increases | Avg session duration | >2min (currently ~1.2min) | <3s LCP, <0.15 CLS |
| **Engagement** | Increase content discovery | Track filter usage | Filter click rate | >40% visitors use filters | <5% filter errors |
| **Adoption** | Grow newsletter subscribers | Newsletter signups | Signup conversion rate | >5% of visitors (currently 2%) | <$3 CAC via newsletter |
| **Retention** | Increase repeat visitors | Return visits within 30 days | 30-day return rate | >25% (currently ~15%) | <20%/month churn |
| **Task Success** | Improve content findability | Post click-through | Homepage â†’ blog CTR | >35% (currently ~20%) | <10s to find relevant post |

**Performance Targets** (from `design/systems/budgets.md`):
- FCP <1.5s, TTI <3.5s, CLS <0.15, LCP <2.5s
- Lighthouse Performance â‰¥85, Accessibility â‰¥95

See `.spec-flow/templates/heart-metrics-template.md` for full measurement plan.

## Screens Inventory (UI Features Only)

> **Purpose**: Define screens for `/design-variations` workflow (Phase 1).

Screens to design:
1. **homepage-hero**: Hero section - Primary action: "Read Latest" or "Subscribe"
2. **homepage-filter-bar**: Content track filter - Primary action: Select filter
3. **homepage-featured**: Featured content showcase - Primary action: "Read Article"
4. **homepage-grid**: Recent posts grid - Primary action: Click post card
5. **homepage-project-card**: "What I'm building" section - Primary action: "Visit Project"
6. **homepage-newsletter**: Newsletter signup CTA - Primary action: "Subscribe"
7. **homepage-mobile-nav**: Mobile navigation menu - Primary action: Filter selection

States per screen: `default`, `loading`, `empty`, `error`

See `.spec-flow/templates/screens-yaml-template.yaml` for full screen definitions.

## Hypothesis

> **Purpose**: State the problem, solution, and predicted improvement.
> **Format**: Problem â†’ Solution â†’ Prediction (with magnitude)

**Problem**: Current homepage design is outdated and doesn't effectively surface dual-track content (Aviation + Dev/Startup), leading to high bounce rates and poor content discovery
- Evidence:
  - Bounce rate ~55% (industry avg ~40%)
  - Avg session duration ~1.2min (target >2min)
  - No clear content filtering â†’ visitors miss relevant content
  - Outdated visual design doesn't reflect brand quality
- Impact: Visitors don't understand value proposition, can't find relevant content, don't convert to newsletter subscribers

**Solution**: Modernize homepage with brand tokens (navy palette), add hero section with clear value proposition, implement content track filtering (Aviation/Dev), showcase featured posts, and prominently display newsletter CTA
- Change:
  - Hero section with brand identity + primary CTA
  - Content track filtering (client-side, no reload)
  - Featured posts section (manual curation)
  - Recent posts grid with improved layout
  - "What I'm building" project card
  - Prominent newsletter signup
- Mechanism: Clear value proposition reduces confusion, filtering improves content discovery, modern design builds trust, newsletter CTA increases conversions

**Prediction**: New homepage design will reduce bounce rate from 55% to <45% and increase newsletter signups from 2% to >5% by improving content discovery and brand perception
- Primary metric: Newsletter signup conversion rate: 2% â†’ >5% (+150% increase)
- Secondary metric: Bounce rate: 55% â†’ <45% (-18% reduction)
- Tertiary metric: Homepage â†’ blog CTR: 20% â†’ >35% (+75% increase)
- Expected improvement: +150% newsletter signups, -18% bounce rate, +75% blog CTR
- Confidence: High (similar pattern in design-inspirations.md, proven track filtering UX pattern)

## Context Strategy & Signal Design

- **System prompt altitude**: Component-level UI implementation with brand token awareness
- **Tool surface**: Read (brand docs, UI components), Edit (components), Glob (find existing patterns), Grep (find usage examples) - token-efficient tools only
- **Examples in scope**: â‰¤3 canonical examples (Hero component, filter bar, post card)
- **Context budget**: Target 50k tokens for planning phase (homepage redesign = high UI complexity)
- **Retrieval strategy**: JIT (just-in-time) for component patterns, upfront for brand tokens and color palette
- **Memory artifacts**: `NOTES.md` updated after each phase checkpoint (design decisions, component choices), no TODO.md (use tasks.md from /tasks phase)
- **Compaction cadence**: After research if >40k tokens, preserve brand decisions and component inventory
- **Sub-agents**: None (single-page UI redesign, no backend/API changes)

## Measurement Plan

> **Purpose**: Define how success will be measured using Claude Code-accessible sources.
> **Sources**: SQL queries, structured logs, Lighthouse CI, database aggregates.

### Data Collection

**Analytics Events** (dual instrumentation):
- PostHog (dashboards): `posthog.capture(event_name, properties)`
- Structured logs (Claude measurement): `logger.info({ event, ...props })`
- Database (A/B tests): `db.featureMetrics.create({ feature, variant, outcome, value })`

**Key Events to Track**:
1. `homepage.page_view` - Engagement (track source: direct, organic, referral)
2. `homepage.filter_click` - Task Success (track: filter selected, post count)
3. `homepage.post_click` - Task Success (track: post slug, position, filtered view)
4. `homepage.newsletter_signup` - Adoption (primary metric)
5. `homepage.project_card_click` - Engagement (track: project name, CTA clicked)
6. `homepage.error` - Happiness (inverse) (track: error type, component)

### Measurement Queries

**SQL** (`specs/055-homepage-redesign/design/queries/*.sql`):
- Newsletter signup conversion: `SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE event='homepage.newsletter_signup') * 100.0 / COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE event='homepage.page_view') FROM analytics_events WHERE date >= '2025-11-01'`
- Filter usage rate: `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) FILTER (WHERE event='homepage.filter_click') * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) FILTER (WHERE event='homepage.page_view') FROM analytics_events WHERE date >= '2025-11-01'`
- Homepage â†’ blog CTR: `SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE event='homepage.post_click') * 100.0 / COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE event='homepage.page_view') FROM analytics_events WHERE date >= '2025-11-01'`

**Logs** (`logs/metrics/*.jsonl`):
- Event counts: `grep '"feature":"homepage-redesign"' logs/metrics/*.jsonl | jq -r '.event' | sort | uniq -c`
- Error rate: `grep '"event":"homepage.error"' logs/metrics/*.jsonl | wc -l` / total events * 100
- Session duration P50/P95: `jq -r 'select(.event=="homepage.page_view") | .session_duration' logs/metrics/*.jsonl | sort -n | awk '{a[NR]=$1} END {print "P50:", a[int(NR*0.50)], "P95:", a[int(NR*0.95)]}'`

**Lighthouse** (`.lighthouseci/results/*.json`):
- Performance: `jq '.categories.performance.score' .lighthouseci/results/lhr-*.json | awk '{sum+=$1; count++} END {print sum/count}'`
- FCP/LCP/CLS: `jq '.audits["first-contentful-paint"].numericValue, .audits["largest-contentful-paint"].numericValue, .audits["cumulative-layout-shift"].numericValue' .lighthouseci/results/lhr-*.json`

### Experiment Design (A/B Test)

**Variants**:
- Control: Current homepage (outdated design, no filtering, old layout)
- Treatment: New homepage (hero section, track filtering, featured posts, project card, newsletter CTA)

**Ramp Plan**:
1. Internal (Days 1-3): Test with personal devices, ~5 users, monitor errors
2. 10% (Days 4-7): Random 10%, monitor filter usage and newsletter signups
3. 50% (Days 8-14): Accumulate statistical power for conversion metrics
4. 100% (Days 15+): Full rollout if newsletter signups >4% and no critical errors

**Kill Switch**: Error rate >5% OR LCP >4s OR newsletter signup rate <1.5% â†’ instant rollback

**Sample Size**: ~385 visitors per variant (5% â†’ 7% MDE, 80% power, Î±=0.05) - estimated 7-10 days to reach

See `.spec-flow/templates/experiment-design-template.md` for full plan.
