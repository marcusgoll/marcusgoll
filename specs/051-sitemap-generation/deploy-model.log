=== Deployment Model Verification ===

From workflow-state.yaml:
deployment_model: staging-prod # Options: staging-prod, direct-prod, local-only

Deployment model analysis:
✅ Model: staging-prod (as documented)
✅ Platform coupling: None (framework-native Next.js)
✅ Works on Vercel, VPS, AWS, any Node.js hosting
✅ No platform-specific features used

Staging workflow:
- optimize → preview → ship-staging → validate-staging → ship-prod
