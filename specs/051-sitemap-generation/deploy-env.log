=== Environment Variables Check ===

Checking .env.local:
PUBLIC_URL="http://178.156.129.179:3000"

Fallback behavior:
✅ Code uses fallback: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL || 'https://marcusgoll.com'
⚠️  Warning displayed during build (see deploy-build.log)

Production deployment:
✅ Should set NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://marcusgoll.com in production environment
