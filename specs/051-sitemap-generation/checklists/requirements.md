# Specification Quality Checklist: Sitemap Generation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: specs/051-sitemap-generation/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - Spec focuses on "what" not "how" (uses Next.js as context, not implementation detail)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
  - Clear user stories for search engines and content creator
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - Language accessible, explains SEO benefits
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed
  - All template sections present and filled

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3)
  - Zero clarification markers (feature is well-defined)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - All FR/NFR have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
  - 6 success criteria, all verifiable (HTTP 200, URL count, metadata values, build automation, Google validation)
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - Success criteria focus on outcomes (accessible sitemap, correct metadata, automatic updates)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - 4 acceptance scenarios covering main flows
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
  - 4 edge cases documented with fallback strategies
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded
  - In-scope/out-of-scope section explicit about Phase 1 vs Phase 2
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - 3 technical dependencies listed, 6 assumptions documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - 6 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-006) with implementation guidance
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows
  - 4 scenarios cover search engine discovery, automatic updates, priority/frequency
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - 6 success criteria align with user stories and requirements
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification
  - Spec is outcome-focused, uses Next.js only as context (not prescriptive implementation)

## Notes

All checklist items passed. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear hypothesis with measurable prediction (100% sitemap freshness)
- Well-defined scope (MVP includes posts + static pages, defers image sitemap)
- Strong technical context from existing implementation analysis
- Zero ambiguities (no clarifications needed)

**Validation**:
- Sitemap accessible at /sitemap.xml ✓
- All published posts included ✓
- Static pages included ✓
- Priority and change frequency set ✓
- Last modified dates from frontmatter ✓
- robots.txt already references sitemap ✓
- Google Search Console validation (manual step) ✓
- Automatic updates on build ✓
