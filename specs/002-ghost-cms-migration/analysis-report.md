## Findings

| ID | Category | Severity | Location | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| C1 | Consistency | MEDIUM | tasks.md:85 | getPrimaryTrack helper not yet implemented in lib/ghost.ts but referenced as REUSE | Verify existing Ghost API client or mark as NEW to create in T005 |
| C2 | Clarity | MEDIUM | tasks.md:236 | Ghost Admin configuration task (T036) creates checklist but doesn't include actual Ghost Admin actions | Add note that Ghost Admin configuration is manual (out-of-scope for automated workflow) |
| D1 | Documentation | MEDIUM | tasks.md:353-360 | T090 documents Ghost Admin setup in NOTES.md, but Ghost Admin actions are manual | Clarify that T090 documents the process, not performs it |
| T1 | Terminology | LOW | spec.md:163, plan.md:62 | Spec uses "primary tag hierarchy" while plan uses "tag-based content organization" for same concept | Terminology is semantically equivalent, no action needed |
| T2 | Terminology | LOW | spec.md:106, plan.md:321 | Spec uses "PostCard component" while plan uses "Blog Post Card" in heading | Minor wording difference, functionally identical |

## Detailed Analysis

### Constitution Violations
None found.

### Coverage Gaps
None found. All 37 requirements have corresponding tasks.

### Duplication Detection
No duplicate requirements detected. Requirements are specific and non-overlapping.

### Ambiguity Detection

**Vague Terms in NFRs**:
- NFR-001, NFR-002: Use specific metrics (<2s FCP, <3s LCP) - GOOD
- NFR-003: Uses p50/p95 percentiles - GOOD
- NFR-006: Uses specific contrast ratios (4.5:1, 3:1) - GOOD
- No ambiguous terms requiring clarification

**Placeholders**: None found

### Underspecification

**User Story Acceptance Criteria**:
All 5 scenarios include testable acceptance criteria in spec.md:
- Scenario 1: Lines 42-46
- Scenario 2: Lines 50-55
- Scenario 3: Lines 59-64
- Scenario 4: Lines 69-72
- Scenario 5: Lines 75-80

**Component Definitions**:
All referenced components defined in plan.md:
- TrackBadge: plan.md:315-320
- PostCard: plan.md:321-327
- PostGrid: plan.md:328-333
- Hero: plan.md:334-342

- Header: plan.md:351-358
- Footer: plan.md:359-365
- Button: plan.md:367-371
- Container: plan.md:373-377

### Inconsistency Detection

**Terminology Drift**:
Minor terminology variations detected but semantically equivalent:
- "primary tag hierarchy" (spec) vs "tag-based content organization" (plan)
- "PostCard component" (spec) vs "Blog Post Card" (plan heading)

No action required - meaning is clear from context.

**Technology Stack Conflicts**: None

Single consistent tech stack across all artifacts:
- Next.js 15.5.6
- React 19.2.0
- Tailwind CSS 4.1.15
- Ghost Content API
- TypeScript 5.9.3

## Performance Readiness

**Performance Targets Defined**:
- First Contentful Paint: <2s (NFR-001)
- Largest Contentful Paint: <3s (NFR-002)
- Ghost API Response Time: <200ms p50, <500ms p95 (NFR-003)
- ISR Revalidation: 60s (NFR-004)

**Optimization Strategy**:
- ISR caching (T057) - 95% reduction in API calls
- Image optimization (T056) - Next.js Image component
- Static generation at build time
- Lighthouse audit during /optimize phase

**Monitoring Plan**: Documented in T092 (performance monitoring setup)

---

## Security Readiness

**Security Requirements**:
- NFR-013: Ghost Content API key in env vars
- NFR-014: Read-only Content API (not Admin API)
- NFR-015: No env vars committed to version control

**Implementation**:
- T003: .env.example with placeholders (safe to commit)
- Ghost API client (lib/ghost.ts) uses env vars
- Security review during /optimize phase

No security gaps identified.

---

## Accessibility Readiness

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- NFR-005: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- NFR-006: 4.5:1 text contrast, 3:1 UI contrast
- NFR-007: Keyboard navigation support
- NFR-008: Track badge contrast

**Implementation**:
- T008: Button component with keyboard nav, focus states
- T015: TrackBadge with WCAG AA contrast
- T080: Header with keyboard-accessible nav
- Lighthouse a11y audit during /optimize phase

No accessibility gaps identified.

## Recommendations

### 1. Clarify getPrimaryTrack Helper Status (MEDIUM)

**Issue**: tasks.md:85 marks getPrimaryTrack as "REUSE: GhostTag interface" but helper function itself not found in lib/ghost.ts

**Recommendation**:
- Option A: Verify if getPrimaryTrack exists in lib/ghost.ts and update task description
- Option B: Clarify that T005 will CREATE getPrimaryTrack helper (not reuse)

**Impact**: Low - does not block implementation, just task description clarity

### 2. Document Manual Ghost Admin Actions (MEDIUM)

**Issue**: T036 and T090 reference Ghost Admin configuration but don't clarify these are manual actions

**Recommendation**: Add note in tasks.md that Ghost Admin configuration is performed manually in Ghost CMS UI, not via automated scripts

**Impact**: Low - prevents confusion during implementation

### 3. Add Analytics Validation Checklist (LOW)

**Issue**: Analytics events defined (T046, T085, T086) but no explicit test checklist

**Recommendation**: Add to T091 deployment checklist: "Verify analytics events fire in GA4 Realtime"

**Impact**: Very Low - already implied by deployment checklist structure

---

## Next Actions

PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION

Next command: `/implement`

/implement will:
1. Execute tasks from tasks.md (31 tasks)
2. Follow TDD where applicable
3. Reference existing Ghost API client (lib/ghost.ts)
4. Commit after each task phase
5. Update NOTES.md with decisions and blockers

**Estimated Duration**: 26-34 hours (from tasks.md:398-402)

**MVP Scope**: Phase 1-4 (15 tasks) - Basic dual-track content display

**Dependencies**:
- Ghost CMS instance accessible (assumption verified in spec.md:251)
- Ghost Content API key available (assumption verified in spec.md:252)
- Environment variables configured before deployment
