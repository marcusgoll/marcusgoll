- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ All checks passed

**Summary**:
- 0 clarification markers found
- 16/16 checklist items complete
- Specification is clear, complete, and ready for planning phase

## Notes

**Strengths**:
1. Comprehensive user stories covering all interaction modes (desktop, mobile, keyboard, screen reader)
2. Clear success criteria with measurable outcomes (< 100ms response, WCAG 2.1 AA, 44x44px touch targets)
3. Existing infrastructure documented (next-themes, CSS variables, ThemeProvider)
4. Accessibility requirements detailed (ARIA labels, keyboard support, focus indicators)
5. Out of scope items clearly defined
6. No breaking changes or deployment complexity

**Edge Cases Covered**:
- System theme detection on first visit
- localStorage blocked scenarios
- JavaScript disabled fallback
- Hydration edge cases (already handled by suppressHydrationWarning)

**Assumptions Validated**:
- next-themes localStorage persistence ✅ (package already integrated)
- CSS variables sufficient for both themes ✅ (validated in globals.css)
- Code block themes work ✅ (syntax highlighting CSS already supports media queries)

Ready to proceed to `/plan` phase.
