# Feature: Dokploy Deployment Platform Integration

## Overview

Integrate Dokploy (self-hosted deployment platform) on Hetzner VPS to provide Vercel-like developer experience while maintaining self-hosted control and cost efficiency.

**Feature Type**: Infrastructure Enhancement
**Deployment Model**: direct-prod (current), enables future staging-prod
**Scope**: DevOps improvement, no end-user visible changes

## Research Findings

### Constitution Alignment
- âœ… **Aligned with Project Values**: Self-hosted infrastructure, full control, no vendor lock-in
- âœ… **Supports Growth**: Enables staging environment when traffic > 10K/mo
- âœ… **DevOps Learning**: Demonstrates full-stack skills, portfolio value
- âœ… **Cost-Effective**: No SaaS costs beyond existing VPS ($0 additional cost)

**Source**: `.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md` - Deployment Model (staging-prod), Version Management

### Current Deployment Stack
**From**: `docs/project/deployment-strategy.md`, `docs/project/tech-stack.md`

**Current State**:
- Hetzner VPS (Docker-based)
- Manual deployment via `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- GitHub Actions CI/CD (verify, build, deploy)
- Self-hosted Supabase PostgreSQL
- Caddy reverse proxy (in Docker)
- No staging environment
- Direct-to-production deploys

**Pain Points Confirmed**:
1. Manual Docker commands required for non-CI deploys
2. No visual dashboard for monitoring resources
3. Environment variables managed manually on VPS
4. Rollback requires manual Docker image tracking
5. Adding staging environment would require significant manual setup

### Tech Stack Context
**From**: `docs/project/tech-stack.md`

**Current Infrastructure**:
- **Platform**: Hetzner VPS (â‚¬20-30/mo, 2-4 vCPUs, 4-8GB RAM, 80-160GB SSD)
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Web Server**: Caddy (reverse proxy, automatic HTTPS)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Application**: Next.js 15.5.6, Node 20, TypeScript 5.9.3
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ (via Supabase self-hosted)
- **ORM**: Prisma 6.17.1

**Constraints**:
- Must maintain self-hosted architecture (no migration to managed services)
- Budget: <$50/mo total infrastructure (current ~$25-35/mo)
- Performance: Lighthouse â‰¥85, FCP <1.5s
- Solo developer: Simplicity valued over enterprise features

### Dokploy Platform Research
**From**: GitHub Issue #47, Dokploy website

**What is Dokploy**:
- Open-source, self-hosted deployment platform (alternative to Vercel/Netlify/Heroku)
- Docker-based (fits existing infrastructure)
- Web UI for application, database, and monitoring management
- Supports Docker, Nixpacks, Heroku Buildpacks, Docker Compose
- Multi-server support (enables staging when needed)
- API and CLI for automation
- Built-in monitoring (CPU, memory, network, logs)
- Database management (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, MariaDB)
- GitHub webhook integration (push-to-deploy)

**Compatibility with Current Stack**:
- âœ… Uses Docker underneath (no rewrite needed)
- âœ… Supports Next.js (via Nixpacks or Docker)
- âœ… Manages PostgreSQL databases
- âœ… Supports environment variable management
- âœ… Provides monitoring dashboard
- âœ… GitHub integration for CI/CD
- âœ… Subdomain SSL via Let's Encrypt

**Resource Requirements**:
- Dokploy UI: ~500MB RAM, minimal CPU
- Current VPS capacity: 4-8GB RAM (sufficient headroom)
- No additional server needed (runs on existing VPS)

### Migration Strategy
**Zero-Downtime Approach** (from GitHub Issue #47):

1. **Phase 1**: Install Dokploy on VPS without disrupting current deployment
   - Dokploy runs on different port (default: 3000 for UI)
   - Current Next.js app continues on port 80/443

2. **Phase 2**: Configure Dokploy in parallel
   - Set up application in Dokploy with test subdomain
   - Import PostgreSQL database to Dokploy management
   - Test deployment pipeline

3. **Phase 3**: Validation
   - Verify Dokploy deployment matches production functionality
   - Performance testing (ensure no regression)
   - Rollback testing (verify quick recovery)

4. **Phase 4**: Cutover
   - Update Caddyfile to point marcusgoll.com to Dokploy-managed app
   - Monitor for 24-48 hours
   - Decommission old Docker Compose setup

**Rollback Plan**:
- Keep old docker-compose.prod.yml for 7 days
- If Dokploy issues arise, revert Caddyfile
- Dokploy is abstraction layer (can always extract Docker configs)

### Benefits Analysis

**Developer Experience**:
- âœ… Push to GitHub â†’ auto-deploy (like Vercel)
- âœ… Visual dashboard for deployment status
- âœ… Environment variables via UI (no SSH needed)
- âœ… One-click rollback via UI
- âœ… Real-time logs and monitoring

**Operational Efficiency**:
- âœ… Time savings: ~2-3 hours/month (manual deployment tasks eliminated)
- âœ… Reduced error rate: GUI reduces manual command errors
- âœ… Faster staging setup: When needed, add via UI (vs. manual server provisioning)

**Portfolio Value**:
- âœ… Demonstrates modern DevOps practices
- âœ… Shows platform engineering skills
- âœ… Self-hosted alternative to cloud platforms

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1**: Dokploy adds complexity layer
- **Mitigation**: Can fallback to manual Docker if needed; Dokploy is just abstraction
- **Evidence**: Docker configs remain accessible, not locked in

**Risk 2**: Learning curve for new tool
- **Mitigation**: Well-documented, similar to Vercel/Netlify UX
- **Evidence**: Active community, good documentation on dokploy.com

**Risk 3**: Dokploy becomes unmaintained (open-source risk)
- **Mitigation**: Can extract Docker configs and run manually; not locked in
- **Evidence**: Active development, 2K+ stars on GitHub

**Risk 4**: VPS resource overhead
- **Mitigation**: Dokploy lightweight (~500MB RAM); VPS has capacity
- **Evidence**: 4-8GB RAM VPS, currently underutilized

**Risk 5**: Configuration drift (Dokploy config vs. Dockerfile)
- **Mitigation**: Version-control Dokploy configs via API/CLI
- **Evidence**: Dokploy has CLI for exporting configuration

## Feature Classification
- UI screens: false (infrastructure, no end-user UI)
- Improvement: true (improves existing deployment workflow)
- Measurable: true (time savings, deployment frequency, error rate)
- Deployment impact: true (changes deployment platform, environment management)

## Project Documentation Findings

## Phase 4: Implementation (2025-10-26)

**Summary**:
- Approach: Documentation-driven (infrastructure feature requiring VPS access)
- Implementation guides created for all 39 tasks across 8 phases
- Guides provide step-by-step commands, validation checklists, rollback procedures
- User will execute manually on VPS (Claude Code doesn't have VPS SSH access)

**Implementation Strategy**:

This is an infrastructure migration feature that requires:
- SSH access to Hetzner VPS (not available in Claude Code environment)
- Root/sudo privileges for Docker, Caddy, DNS configuration
- Production server modifications

Therefore, implementation phase focused on creating **comprehensive documentation**:
- Step-by-step execution guides with exact commands
- Configuration files and script templates
- Validation checklists for each task
- Rollback procedures at each phase
- Troubleshooting guidance

**Documentation Created**:

1. **Pre-Migration Setup Guide** (`implementation-guides/01-pre-migration-setup.md`)
   - Tasks: T001-T004 (VPS snapshot, backups, prerequisites, DNS)
   - Duration: 30-45 minutes
   - Deliverables: VPS snapshot, config backups, deploy.marcusgoll.com DNS

2. **Dokploy Installation Guide** (`implementation-guides/02-dokploy-installation.md`)
   - Tasks: T005-T008 (install Dokploy, Caddy config, SSL, admin access)
   - Duration: 45-60 minutes
   - Deliverables: Dokploy running at https://deploy.marcusgoll.com

3. **Application Migration Guide** (`implementation-guides/03-application-migration.md`)
   - Tasks: T009-T015 (GitHub integration, build config, env vars, test deployment)
   - Duration: 2-3 hours
   - Deliverables: App deployed to test.marcusgoll.com, validated

4. **Database, CI/CD, Cutover & Validation Guide** (`implementation-guides/04-database-cicd-cutover-validation.md`)
   - Tasks: T016-T037 (database backups, GitHub webhooks, production cutover, monitoring, cleanup)
   - Duration: 4-6 hours + 24-48h monitoring
   - Deliverables: Production on Dokploy, automation configured, old infra cleaned

5. **Master Implementation Guide** (`implementation-guides/README.md`)
   - Overview of all phases
   - Execution order and dependencies
   - Validation checkpoints
   - Success criteria and metrics
   - Emergency rollback procedures

**Task Documentation Coverage**:

**MVP Tasks Documented** (34 tasks):
- âœ… Phase 1 (T001-T004): Pre-migration setup
- âœ… Phase 2 (T005-T008): Dokploy installation
- âœ… Phase 3 (T009-T015): Application migration
- âœ… Phase 4 (T016-T018): Database integration
- âœ… Phase 5 (T019-T022): CI/CD integration
- âœ… Phase 6 (T024-T027): Production cutover
- âœ… Phase 7 (T028, T030, T032-T037): Validation & cleanup

**Optional Enhancement Tasks Documented** (3 tasks):
- âœ… T023 (US6): Deployment notifications

- âœ… T031 (US8): Dokploy configuration export

**Future Tasks Documented** (2 tasks):
- âœ… T038 (US10): Staging environment setup (research phase)
- âœ… T039: Advanced monitoring integrations (research phase)

**Key Documentation Features**:

1. **Exact Commands**: Copy-paste ready bash/PowerShell commands
2. **Validation Checklists**: Verify each step before proceeding
3. **Rollback Procedures**: At phase level and emergency nuclear option
4. **Troubleshooting**: Common errors with solutions
5. **Time Estimates**: Realistic durations for planning
6. **Dependencies**: Clear execution order (sequential vs parallel)
7. **Configuration Templates**: Caddyfile configs, env variable schemas
8. **Safety Mechanisms**: VPS snapshot, config backups, parallel testing

**Parallel Execution Opportunities Documented**:

- **Phase 1**: T001, T002, T003 can start simultaneously (different checks)
- **Phase 4 & 5**: Can run in parallel after Phase 3 (database + CI/CD independent)
- **Phase 7**: T033, T034, T035, T036 can run in parallel (different validations)

**Batching Strategy Used**:

Unlike code implementation (which would use parallel Task() calls), this documentation-based implementation organized guides by:
- **Batch 1**: Phase 1 guide (setup prerequisites)
- **Batch 2**: Phase 2 guide (Dokploy install)
- **Batch 3**: Phase 3 guide (application migration)
- **Batch 4-7**: Consolidated guide (database, CI/CD, cutover, validation)

Consolidation in Batch 4-7 was for token efficiency while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

**Zero-Downtime Migration Approach**:

Guides implement blue-green deployment pattern:
1. Install Dokploy on separate port (3000) - production unaffected
2. Configure and test on subdomain (test.marcusgoll.com) - production unaffected
3. Validate functionality - production still on old infrastructure
4. Cutover Caddy routing to Dokploy - < 1 second switch
5. Monitor production on Dokploy - rollback available via Caddyfile revert

**Rollback Capability** (multi-level):

1. **Level 1** (Preferred): Dokploy UI rollback (<5 min)
   - Select previous deployment, one-click rollback

2. **Level 2**: Caddyfile revert (<10 min)
   - Restore backup Caddyfile, point to old Docker Compose

3. **Level 3**: VPS snapshot restoration (5-20 min)
   - Full VPS rollback via Hetzner dashboard

**Quality Gates Included**:

- Pre-flight: VPS snapshot must exist before proceeding
- Phase 3 gate: Test deployment must pass all functional tests
- Phase 6 gate: Production validation must pass (performance, functionality, security)
- Phase 7 gate: 24-hour stability monitoring before cleanup

**Success Metrics Defined**:

- Deployment time: <7 minutes (NFR-002)
- Site response time: <2s, no >50ms regression (NFR-003)
- Dokploy UI response: <2s (NFR-001)
- Resource overhead: <500MB RAM for Dokploy (NFR-021)
- Backup success: 100% (NFR-011)
- Rollback time: <5 minutes (FR-026)
- Time savings: 60% (30 min â†’ 1 min per deployment)

**Next Steps for User (Marcus)**:

1. **Review master guide**: `implementation-guides/README.md`
2. **Schedule migration window**: Plan 4-6 hours for active work
3. **Start with Phase 1**: `implementation-guides/01-pre-migration-setup.md`
4. **Execute T001 first**: Create VPS snapshot (critical safety checkpoint)
5. **Follow guides sequentially**: Each phase builds on previous
6. **Document as you go**: Update NOTES.md with actual times, issues encountered
7. **Validate at each checkpoint**: Don't skip validation steps
8. **Monitor Phase 7**: 24-48 hour observation period post-cutover

**Implementation Status**: âœ… DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE

**Files Created**: 5 markdown guides (~15,000 words total)

**Ready for**: User (Marcus) to execute on VPS with full documentation support

**Checkpoint**:
- âœ… Dependency analysis complete (39 tasks analyzed)
- âœ… Parallel batching strategy defined
- âœ… Phase 1-2 guides created (setup + install)
- âœ… Phase 3 guide created (application migration)
- âœ… Phase 4-7 consolidated guide created (database, CI/CD, cutover, validation)
- âœ… Master implementation guide created
- âœ… All 39 tasks documented with execution steps
- âœ… Validation checklists included for all tasks
- âœ… Rollback procedures documented at multiple levels
- ðŸ“‹ Ready for: User execution on VPS

**Next Phase**: User will execute migration manually using guides, then update NOTES.md with actual progress. After successful migration, update project documentation (deployment-strategy.md, etc.)

## Phase 2 Execution: Dokploy Installation (2025-10-27)

**Summary**:
- Status: âœ… COMPLETE
- Duration: 35-45 minutes (actual)
- Tasks: T005-T008 (all 4 tasks completed)
- Deliverables: Dokploy running and accessible at https://deploy.marcusgoll.com

### T005: Install Dokploy via Official Installation Script

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE

**Execution Details**:
- Installation date: 2025-10-27, 14:35 UTC
- Installation method: Custom docker-compose.yml (official installer failed due to Caddy port 80 conflict)
- Docker Compose version: 3.8 (modern format)

**Containers Created**:
1. **dokploy** (Image: dokploy/dokploy:latest)
   - Port: 9100:3000 (internal port 3000 mapped to host 9100)
   - Status: Running âœ…
   - Health: Healthy

2. **dokploy-postgres** (Image: postgres:15-alpine)
   - Internal port: 5432
   - Database: dokploy (dedicated database for Dokploy)
   - Credentials: dokploy/dokploy (internal use only)
   - Status: Running âœ…
   - Health: Healthy (passes pg_isready)

3. **dokploy-redis** (Image: redis:7-alpine)
   - Internal port: 6379
   - Status: Running âœ…
   - Health: Healthy (passes redis-cli ping)

**Docker Compose File Location**: `/opt/dokploy/docker-compose.yml`

**Docker Swarm Initialization**:
- Docker Swarm was inactive (Dokploy requires it)
- Initialized with: `docker swarm init --advertise-addr 178.156.129.179`
- Node ID: wt0dp5moymuysvfnnryg78qzv (manager)
- Status: âœ… Now active

**Validation Checklist**:
- [x] Dokploy container running and healthy
- [x] PostgreSQL database container running and healthy
- [x] Redis container running and healthy
- [x] All containers in docker-compose network (dokploy_dokploy-network)
- [x] Docker Swarm initialized
- [x] Port 9100 accessible on VPS (reverse proxy target)

**Troubleshooting Notes**:
- Issue 1: Official Dokploy installer failed with "port 80 already in use"
  - Root cause: Caddy reverse proxy already listening on ports 80/443
  - Resolution: Created custom docker-compose.yml with port mapping 9100:3000
  - Learning: Official installers may conflict with existing infrastructure; Docker Compose provides flexibility

- Issue 2: First docker-compose attempt failed (missing Redis and improper networking)
  - Root cause: Incomplete docker-compose configuration
  - Resolution: Added Redis service and proper healthchecks + service dependencies
  - Learning: Dokploy requires Redis for session/queue management

- Issue 3: Docker Swarm inactive
  - Root cause: Dokploy requires Docker Swarm mode for orchestration
  - Resolution: Ran `docker swarm init` with VPS advertise address
  - Learning: Dokploy is built for Swarm; essential for deployment features

**Documentation**:
- Installation method: Custom docker-compose (preferred over official installer due to Caddy compatibility)
- Container management: Docker Compose (production-ready stack)
- Persistence: Volumes for Dokploy data and PostgreSQL data
- Networking: Custom docker network (dokploy_dokploy-network)

### Metrics & Observations

**Infrastructure Status**:
- Dokploy: Running on port 3000 (internal), 9100 (host)
- PostgreSQL: Running, healthy, initialized
- Redis: Running, healthy
- Caddy: Integrated with Dokploy network
- Docker Swarm: Active (essential for deployments)
- Disk usage: 122GB free (sufficient)
- CPU: Moderate (Dokploy lightweight)
- RAM: ~500MB for Dokploy stack (VPS has 4-8GB)

**Network Configuration**:
- DNS: deploy.marcusgoll.com â†’ 178.156.129.179 âœ…
- SSL: Let's Encrypt auto-provisioned âœ…
- Firewall: Ports 80, 443 open âœ…
- Caddy integration: Multi-network setup working âœ…

**Quality Gates Passed**:
- [x] Dokploy installation succeeded
- [x] Caddy integration successful
- [x] HTTPS access functional
- [x] Docker Swarm initialized
- [x] Resource overhead acceptable

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **Official installer port conflict**
   - Expected: Standard installation
   - Actual: Official installer requires port 80 (Caddy already using)
   - Resolution: Custom docker-compose.yml with port mapping
   - Impact: Minimal (more control, better integration)

2. **Docker network isolation**
   - Expected: localhost:9100 would work from Caddy
   - Actual: Different networks caused 502 Bad Gateway
   - Resolution: Connected Caddy to Dokploy network, used service DNS
   - Impact: Required one extra Docker network connect command

3. **Docker Swarm inactive**
   - Expected: Might work without Swarm
   - Actual: Dokploy requires Swarm for full functionality
   - Resolution: `docker swarm init` with VPS advertise address
   - Impact: Essential for deployment features (now working)

### Time Spent
- T005: ~20 minutes (troubleshooting installer, creating docker-compose)
- T006: ~10 minutes (Caddyfile editing, network connection)
- T007: ~3 minutes (SSL verification)
- T008: ~2 minutes (documentation + instructions)
- **Total Phase 2: ~35 minutes** (vs. 45-60 min estimate = 25% faster)

### Readiness for Phase 3
- Dokploy UI: âœ… Running and accessible
- Admin access: âœ… Ready for user to register
- Docker Swarm: âœ… Initialized
- Network integration: âœ… Working
- SSL/TLS: âœ… Auto-provisioned
- **Status**: Ready to proceed to Phase 3 (Application Migration)
