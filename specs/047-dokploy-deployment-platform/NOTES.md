# Feature: Dokploy Deployment Platform Integration

## Overview

Integrate Dokploy (self-hosted deployment platform) on Hetzner VPS to provide Vercel-like developer experience while maintaining self-hosted control and cost efficiency.

**Feature Type**: Infrastructure Enhancement
**Deployment Model**: direct-prod (current), enables future staging-prod
**Scope**: DevOps improvement, no end-user visible changes

## Research Findings

### Constitution Alignment
- âœ… **Aligned with Project Values**: Self-hosted infrastructure, full control, no vendor lock-in
- âœ… **Supports Growth**: Enables staging environment when traffic > 10K/mo
- âœ… **DevOps Learning**: Demonstrates full-stack skills, portfolio value
- âœ… **Cost-Effective**: No SaaS costs beyond existing VPS ($0 additional cost)

**Source**: `.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md` - Deployment Model (staging-prod), Version Management

### Current Deployment Stack
**From**: `docs/project/deployment-strategy.md`, `docs/project/tech-stack.md`

**Current State**:
- Hetzner VPS (Docker-based)
- Manual deployment via `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- GitHub Actions CI/CD (verify, build, deploy)
- Self-hosted Supabase PostgreSQL
- Caddy reverse proxy (in Docker)
- No staging environment
- Direct-to-production deploys

**Pain Points Confirmed**:
1. Manual Docker commands required for non-CI deploys
2. No visual dashboard for monitoring resources
3. Environment variables managed manually on VPS
4. Rollback requires manual Docker image tracking
5. Adding staging environment would require significant manual setup

### Tech Stack Context
**From**: `docs/project/tech-stack.md`

**Current Infrastructure**:
- **Platform**: Hetzner VPS (â‚¬20-30/mo, 2-4 vCPUs, 4-8GB RAM, 80-160GB SSD)
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Web Server**: Caddy (reverse proxy, automatic HTTPS)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Application**: Next.js 15.5.6, Node 20, TypeScript 5.9.3
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ (via Supabase self-hosted)
- **ORM**: Prisma 6.17.1

**Constraints**:
- Must maintain self-hosted architecture (no migration to managed services)
- Budget: <$50/mo total infrastructure (current ~$25-35/mo)
- Performance: Lighthouse â‰¥85, FCP <1.5s
- Solo developer: Simplicity valued over enterprise features

### Dokploy Platform Research
**From**: GitHub Issue #47, Dokploy website

**What is Dokploy**:
- Open-source, self-hosted deployment platform (alternative to Vercel/Netlify/Heroku)
- Docker-based (fits existing infrastructure)
- Web UI for application, database, and monitoring management
- Supports Docker, Nixpacks, Heroku Buildpacks, Docker Compose
- Multi-server support (enables staging when needed)
- API and CLI for automation
- Built-in monitoring (CPU, memory, network, logs)
- Database management (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, MariaDB)
- GitHub webhook integration (push-to-deploy)

**Compatibility with Current Stack**:
- âœ… Uses Docker underneath (no rewrite needed)
- âœ… Supports Next.js (via Nixpacks or Docker)
- âœ… Manages PostgreSQL databases
- âœ… Supports environment variable management
- âœ… Provides monitoring dashboard
- âœ… GitHub integration for CI/CD
- âœ… Subdomain SSL via Let's Encrypt

**Resource Requirements**:
- Dokploy UI: ~500MB RAM, minimal CPU
- Current VPS capacity: 4-8GB RAM (sufficient headroom)
- No additional server needed (runs on existing VPS)

### Migration Strategy
**Zero-Downtime Approach** (from GitHub Issue #47):

1. **Phase 1**: Install Dokploy on VPS without disrupting current deployment
   - Dokploy runs on different port (default: 3000 for UI)
   - Current Next.js app continues on port 80/443

2. **Phase 2**: Configure Dokploy in parallel
   - Set up application in Dokploy with test subdomain
   - Import PostgreSQL database to Dokploy management
   - Test deployment pipeline

3. **Phase 3**: Validation
   - Verify Dokploy deployment matches production functionality
   - Performance testing (ensure no regression)
   - Rollback testing (verify quick recovery)

4. **Phase 4**: Cutover
   - Update Caddyfile to point marcusgoll.com to Dokploy-managed app
   - Monitor for 24-48 hours
   - Decommission old Docker Compose setup

**Rollback Plan**:
- Keep old docker-compose.prod.yml for 7 days
- If Dokploy issues arise, revert Caddyfile
- Dokploy is abstraction layer (can always extract Docker configs)

### Benefits Analysis

**Developer Experience**:
- âœ… Push to GitHub â†’ auto-deploy (like Vercel)
- âœ… Visual dashboard for deployment status
- âœ… Environment variables via UI (no SSH needed)
- âœ… One-click rollback via UI
- âœ… Real-time logs and monitoring

**Operational Efficiency**:
- âœ… Time savings: ~2-3 hours/month (manual deployment tasks eliminated)
- âœ… Reduced error rate: GUI reduces manual command errors
- âœ… Faster staging setup: When needed, add via UI (vs. manual server provisioning)

**Portfolio Value**:
- âœ… Demonstrates modern DevOps practices
- âœ… Shows platform engineering skills
- âœ… Self-hosted alternative to cloud platforms

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1**: Dokploy adds complexity layer
- **Mitigation**: Can fallback to manual Docker if needed; Dokploy is just abstraction
- **Evidence**: Docker configs remain accessible, not locked in

**Risk 2**: Learning curve for new tool
- **Mitigation**: Well-documented, similar to Vercel/Netlify UX
- **Evidence**: Active community, good documentation on dokploy.com

**Risk 3**: Dokploy becomes unmaintained (open-source risk)
- **Mitigation**: Can extract Docker configs and run manually; not locked in
- **Evidence**: Active development, 2K+ stars on GitHub

**Risk 4**: VPS resource overhead
- **Mitigation**: Dokploy lightweight (~500MB RAM); VPS has capacity
- **Evidence**: 4-8GB RAM VPS, currently underutilized

**Risk 5**: Configuration drift (Dokploy config vs. Dockerfile)
- **Mitigation**: Version-control Dokploy configs via API/CLI
- **Evidence**: Dokploy has CLI for exporting configuration

## Phase 4: Implementation (2025-10-26)

**Summary**:
- Approach: Documentation-driven (infrastructure feature requiring VPS access)
- Implementation guides created for all 39 tasks across 8 phases
- Guides provide step-by-step commands, validation checklists, rollback procedures
- User will execute manually on VPS (Claude Code doesn't have VPS SSH access)

**Implementation Strategy**:

This is an infrastructure migration feature that requires:
- SSH access to Hetzner VPS (not available in Claude Code environment)
- Root/sudo privileges for Docker, Caddy, DNS configuration
- Production server modifications

Therefore, implementation phase focused on creating **comprehensive documentation**:
- Step-by-step execution guides with exact commands
- Configuration files and script templates
- Validation checklists for each task
- Rollback procedures at each phase
- Troubleshooting guidance

**Documentation Created**:

1. **Pre-Migration Setup Guide** (`implementation-guides/01-pre-migration-setup.md`)
   - Tasks: T001-T004 (VPS snapshot, backups, prerequisites, DNS)
   - Duration: 30-45 minutes
   - Deliverables: VPS snapshot, config backups, deploy.marcusgoll.com DNS

2. **Dokploy Installation Guide** (`implementation-guides/02-dokploy-installation.md`)
   - Tasks: T005-T008 (install Dokploy, Caddy config, SSL, admin access)
   - Duration: 45-60 minutes
   - Deliverables: Dokploy running at https://deploy.marcusgoll.com

3. **Application Migration Guide** (`implementation-guides/03-application-migration.md`)

**Key Documentation Features**:

1. **Exact Commands**: Copy-paste ready bash/PowerShell commands
2. **Validation Checklists**: Verify each step before proceeding
3. **Rollback Procedures**: At phase level and emergency nuclear option
4. **Troubleshooting**: Common errors with solutions
5. **Time Estimates**: Realistic durations for planning
6. **Dependencies**: Clear execution order (sequential vs parallel)
7. **Configuration Templates**: Caddyfile configs, env variable schemas
8. **Safety Mechanisms**: VPS snapshot, config backups, parallel testing

**Parallel Execution Opportunities Documented**:

- **Phase 1**: T001, T002, T003 can start simultaneously (different checks)
- **Phase 4 & 5**: Can run in parallel after Phase 3 (database + CI/CD independent)
- **Phase 7**: T033, T034, T035, T036 can run in parallel (different validations)

**Batching Strategy Used**:

Unlike code implementation (which would use parallel Task() calls), this documentation-based implementation organized guides by:
- **Batch 1**: Phase 1 guide (setup prerequisites)
- **Batch 2**: Phase 2 guide (Dokploy install)
- **Batch 3**: Phase 3 guide (application migration)
- **Batch 4-7**: Consolidated guide (database, CI/CD, cutover, validation)

Consolidation in Batch 4-7 was for token efficiency while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

**Zero-Downtime Migration Approach**:

Guides implement blue-green deployment pattern:
1. Install Dokploy on separate port (3000) - production unaffected
2. Configure and test on subdomain (test.marcusgoll.com) - production unaffected
3. Validate functionality - production still on old infrastructure
4. Cutover Caddy routing to Dokploy - < 1 second switch
5. Monitor production on Dokploy - rollback available via Caddyfile revert

**Rollback Capability** (multi-level):

1. **Level 1** (Preferred): Dokploy UI rollback (<5 min)
   - Select previous deployment, one-click rollback

2. **Level 2**: Caddyfile revert (<10 min)
   - Restore backup Caddyfile, point to old Docker Compose

3. **Level 3**: VPS snapshot restoration (5-20 min)
   - Full VPS rollback via Hetzner dashboard

**Quality Gates Included**:

- Pre-flight: VPS snapshot must exist before proceeding
- Phase 3 gate: Test deployment must pass all functional tests
- Phase 6 gate: Production validation must pass (performance, functionality, security)
- Phase 7 gate: 24-hour stability monitoring before cleanup

**Success Metrics Defined**:

- Deployment time: <7 minutes (NFR-002)
- Site response time: <2s, no >50ms regression (NFR-003)
- Dokploy UI response: <2s (NFR-001)
- Resource overhead: <500MB RAM for Dokploy (NFR-021)
- Backup success: 100% (NFR-011)
- Rollback time: <5 minutes (FR-026)
- Time savings: 60% (30 min â†’ 1 min per deployment)

**Next Steps for User (Marcus)**:

1. **Review master guide**: `implementation-guides/README.md`
2. **Schedule migration window**: Plan 4-6 hours for active work
3. **Start with Phase 1**: `implementation-guides/01-pre-migration-setup.md`
4. **Execute T001 first**: Create VPS snapshot (critical safety checkpoint)
5. **Follow guides sequentially**: Each phase builds on previous
6. **Document as you go**: Update NOTES.md with actual times, issues encountered
7. **Validate at each checkpoint**: Don't skip validation steps
8. **Monitor Phase 7**: 24-48 hour observation period post-cutover

**Implementation Status**: âœ… DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE

**Files Created**: 5 markdown guides (~15,000 words total)

**Ready for**: User (Marcus) to execute on VPS with full documentation support

**Checkpoint**:
- âœ… Dependency analysis complete (39 tasks analyzed)
- âœ… Parallel batching strategy defined
