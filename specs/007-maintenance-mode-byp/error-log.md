# Error Log: Maintenance Mode with Secret Bypass

**Feature**: 007-maintenance-mode-byp
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Planning Phase Complete

This document tracks all errors, issues, and resolutions encountered during feature development.

## Planning Phase (Phase 0-2)

### 2025-10-27: Planning Complete

**Status**: âœ… No errors during planning phase

**Planning Activities**:
- Research & discovery completed (11 tool calls)
- Architecture decisions documented
- Design artifacts generated (research.md, plan.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts)
- Reuse opportunities identified (4 components)
- New components defined (4 required)
- All technical unknowns resolved (7/7)

**Key Decisions**:
- Next.js Edge Middleware for request interception
- Environment variables + HTTP cookies for state management
- 256-bit hex token for cryptographic security
- NextResponse.cookies API for cookie handling
- Server-rendered maintenance page for fast load times

**Potential Risks Identified**:
1. Infinite redirect loop (/maintenance not excluded)
2. Token leakage in logs (must mask token)
3. Cookie expiration mid-session (24-hour window)
4. Static assets blocked (must exclude /_next/*)
5. Health check endpoint blocked (must exclude /api/health)

**Mitigations Planned**: All risks have documented mitigation strategies in plan.md

## Implementation Phase (Phase 3-4)

[Populated during /tasks and /implement]

---

## Testing Phase (Phase 5)

[Populated during /debug and /preview]

---

## Deployment Phase (Phase 6-7)

[Populated during staging validation and production deployment]

## Error Categories

### Category 1: Configuration Errors
**Examples**:
- Missing environment variables
- Invalid token format
- Incorrect middleware matcher pattern

**Impact**: High (blocks functionality)
**Detection**: Runtime errors, failed tests, deployment failures

---

### Category 2: Logic Errors
**Examples**:
- Incorrect token validation logic
- Cookie not persisting
- Redirect loop

**Impact**: Critical (breaks core functionality)
**Detection**: Integration tests, manual QA, user reports

---

### Category 3: Security Issues
**Examples**:
- Token exposed in logs
- Cookie flags missing (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- Health check blocked during maintenance

**Impact**: Critical (security vulnerability)
**Detection**: Security audit, code review, penetration testing

---

### Category 4: Performance Issues
**Examples**:
- Middleware overhead >10ms
- Maintenance page FCP >1.5s
- Slow token validation

**Impact**: Medium (degrades UX)
**Detection**: Lighthouse audit, Server-Timing header, performance monitoring

---

### Category 5: Accessibility Issues
**Examples**:
- Low color contrast
- Missing ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation broken

**Impact**: High (legal compliance, inclusivity)
**Detection**: Axe DevTools, manual testing, WCAG audit
