**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: specs/005-dns-domain-mapping/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

All checklist items passed. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

Key strengths:
- Clear, measurable success criteria (ping commands, DNS propagation verification)
- Well-documented assumptions (registrar access, VPS configuration, ports)
- Comprehensive risk assessment with mitigations
- Out of scope clearly defined (prevents scope creep)
- No clarifications needed (infrastructure feature with well-known requirements)
