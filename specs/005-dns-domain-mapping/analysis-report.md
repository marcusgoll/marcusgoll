## Constitution Alignment

### Engineering Principles

**Specification First** ✅
- Complete specification with user stories, acceptance criteria, NFRs
- Out-of-scope items documented
- Dependencies and risks assessed

**Documentation Standards** ✅
- Infrastructure documentation planned (infrastructure/dns/README.md)
- Verification commands with expected output
- Troubleshooting sections planned
- Follows existing infrastructure docs pattern

**Security Practices** ✅
- No credentials in git (documented in plan.md line 180-182)
- DNS records are public (no sensitive data)
- Follows infrastructure security pattern

**Do Not Overengineer** ✅
- Simple DNS A records at registrar (not external DNS service)
- Leverages existing Caddy configuration (no code changes)
- No unnecessary complexity

**Testing Standards** ⚠️
- No automated tests (infrastructure configuration)
- Manual verification documented comprehensively
- Acceptable for infrastructure features

### Brand Principles

**Systematic Clarity** ✅
- Step-by-step verification procedures planned
- Clear troubleshooting guide outlined
- Documentation follows systematic approach

**Not Applicable**:
- Visual Brand Consistency (infrastructure, no UI)
- Multi-Passionate Integration (infrastructure, no content)
- Authentic Building in Public (could document DNS setup as learning)
- Teaching-First Content (could write tutorial about DNS setup)

### Constitution Violations

**None detected** - All applicable principles addressed

---

## Cross-Artifact Consistency

### Terminology Consistency ✅

All artifacts use consistent terminology:
- "DNS A records" (not "DNS entries" or "domain records")
- "marcusgoll.com" (apex domain)
- "www.marcusgoll.com" (www subdomain)
- "178.156.129.179" (VPS IP)
- "Caddy" (reverse proxy)
- "Let's Encrypt" (SSL certificate provider)

### Requirement Traceability ✅

All requirements trace from spec → plan → tasks:
- spec.md defines 3 user stories
- plan.md addresses all user stories in [INTEGRATION SCENARIOS]
- tasks.md maps each user story to specific tasks

Example trace:
- US-001 (spec.md line 33) → Integration Scenarios (quickstart.md) → T013, T014 (tasks.md)

### Data Model Consistency ✅

DNS record specifications consistent across artifacts:
- spec.md FR-001: "@" and "www" A records → 178.156.129.179, TTL 3600
- plan.md [NEW INFRASTRUCTURE - CREATE]: Exact same specifications
- tasks.md T004, T005: Exact same specifications

### Architecture Consistency ✅

All artifacts agree this is infrastructure-only (no code):
- spec.md Out of Scope (line 142): No code changes
- plan.md [ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS] (line 19): "No Code Changes Required"
- tasks.md [NO AUTOMATED TESTS] (line 208): "Infrastructure configuration feature"

---

## Task Quality Analysis

### Task Sizing ✅

All tasks are appropriately sized (5-30 minutes each):
- T001: Create directory (5 min)
- T002: Create README template (30 min)
- T003: Verify registrar access (10 min)
- T004-T005: Create A records (15 min total)
- T006-T020: Documentation and verification (15-30 min each)

### Dependency Ordering ✅

Tasks follow correct dependency order:
1. Phase 1 (Setup): T001, T002 - No dependencies
2. Phase 2 (DNS Config): T003 → T004, T005 → T006 - Sequential
3. Phase 3 (Verification): T007-T011 - Depends on Phase 2, can run parallel
4. Phase 4 (SSL Verification): T012-T015 - Depends on Phase 3
5. Phase 5 (Documentation): T016-T020 - Depends on all previous phases

### Acceptance Criteria ✅

All tasks have clear success criteria:
- T004: Record Type A, Name @, Value 178.156.129.179, TTL 3600
- T008: Commands with expected output (dig returns 178.156.129.179)
- T013: HTTP 200/308, valid SSL certificate, no browser warnings

### Parallelization ✅

Parallel opportunities identified:
- T001 + T002 (documentation preparation)
- T008 + T009 + T010 (verification methods)

## Feature-Specific Analysis

### Infrastructure Feature Characteristics

**No Code Changes**: ✅ Correctly identified
- No frontend development
- No backend development
- No database migrations
- No API contracts
- No automated tests

**Manual Configuration**: ✅ Correctly planned
- DNS A records at registrar (manual UI)
- Documentation creation (manual writing)
- Verification procedures (manual CLI commands)

**Verification Strategy**: ✅ Comprehensive
- Multiple DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, local)
- Multiple tools (ping, dig, nslookup, dnschecker.org)
- SSL certificate validation (openssl, curl, browser)

### Wait Time Management ✅

Tasks correctly account for DNS propagation:
- Phase 2 → Phase 3 blocking wait (1-48 hours)
- Phase 3 → Phase 4 dependency (DNS must resolve before SSL)
- Documented in tasks.md line 90: "DEPENDENCY: Wait for DNS propagation"

### Rollback Planning ✅

Comprehensive rollback documented:
- spec.md Deployment Considerations (line 196-202)
- plan.md [DEPLOYMENT ACCEPTANCE] Rollback Plan (line 427-442)
- tasks.md T018: Document rollback procedure

## Risk Assessment Alignment

### Technical Risks (from spec.md) - All Addressed ✅

| Risk | Mitigation in Plan/Tasks | Status |
|------|--------------------------|--------|
| DNS propagation takes longer than expected | T010 global propagation check, 48hr window | ✅ |
| Incorrect A record configuration | T004, T005 exact specifications, immediate verification T007-T010 | ✅ |
| Registrar account access issues | T003 verify access before starting | ✅ |
| Let's Encrypt ACME challenge fails | T012 monitor Caddy logs, port verification | ✅ |

### Operational Risks - Addressed ✅

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Feature on hold (GitHub Issue #40) | Documented in spec.md line 27-29, tasks can be executed when ready | ⚠️ Medium Issue |
| DNS configuration errors not detected | Multiple verification methods (T008-T010) | ✅ |

---

## Performance Targets Alignment

### NFR-001: Propagation Performance ✅

**Target**: <1 hour for major resolvers (spec.md line 111-113)

**Measurement**: T010 global propagation check via dnschecker.org

**Consistency**: plan.md [PERFORMANCE TARGETS] (line 136-145) matches spec.md

### NFR-002: Reliability ✅

**Target**: 99.9% uptime (spec.md line 115-116)

**Validation**: T008, T009, T010 multi-server verification

**Dependency**: Relies on domain registrar DNS SLA (documented in plan.md line 158)

## Next Actions

**✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

Next: `/implement`

/implement will:
1. Execute tasks from tasks.md (20 tasks)
2. Follow manual configuration procedures
3. Verify DNS propagation using multiple methods
4. Document actual results in infrastructure/dns/README.md
5. Update NOTES.md with configuration details

**Prerequisites Before Starting**:
- [ ] Verify domain registrar account access (T003)
- [ ] Confirm Next.js site production readiness (feature currently on hold per GitHub Issue #40)
- [ ] Verify VPS at 178.156.129.179 is running and accessible

**Estimated Duration**:
- Active work: 1-2 hours
- Wait time: 1-48 hours (DNS propagation)
- Total: Up to 50 hours including wait time

---

## Medium Priority Issues (Recommendations)

### M1: Infrastructure Feature Testing Strategy

**Issue**: No automated tests for infrastructure configuration feature

**Impact**: Medium - Manual verification required for all future DNS changes

**Recommendation**:
- Document comprehensive manual verification checklist (already planned in T007-T015)
- Consider adding automated DNS verification script for future reuse
- Not blocking - manual verification is acceptable for one-time infrastructure setup

### M2: Feature On Hold - Unclear Execution Timing

**Issue**: Feature currently on hold per GitHub Issue #40 (Next.js site not production-ready)

**Impact**: Medium - Tasks are ready but cannot be executed until site is production-ready

**Recommendation**:
- Add prerequisite task to verify production readiness before DNS configuration
- Consider executing DNS configuration early (harmless to point DNS to VPS running Ghost)
- Update spec.md with decision on when to execute (now vs. later)
