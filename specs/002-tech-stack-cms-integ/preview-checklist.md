## User Scenarios (From Spec)

### Scenario 1: Create and Display MDX Post

**Test**: Create an MDX file in `content/posts/` with frontmatter, commit and deploy, verify post appears at `/blog/[slug]`

- [ ] **Result**: [Pass/Fail]
- [ ] Post appears at correct URL `/blog/[slug]`
- [ ] Frontmatter metadata displays correctly (title, date, excerpt, tags, author)
- [ ] **Notes**: _Sample posts already exist (welcome-to-mdx, interactive-mdx-demo)_

### Scenario 2: SEO and URL Preservation

**Test**: Verify existing blog post URLs maintain identical formatting and metadata

- [ ] **Result**: [Pass/Fail]
- [ ] URL structure `/blog/[slug]` is consistent
- [ ] Metadata matches expected structure (title, description, OG tags)
- [ ] **Notes**: _Check head tags for meta information_

### Scenario 3: Interactive React Components

**Test**: Embed React component in MDX content, verify it's interactive and functional

- [ ] **Result**: [Pass/Fail]
- [ ] Navigate to `/blog/interactive-mdx-demo`
- [ ] Verify Demo component is interactive (can type and click button)
- [ ] Verify Callout components render with correct styling
- [ ] **Notes**: _Test state management and props_

### Scenario 4: Tag Filtering

**Test**: Filter posts by tags and categories from blog index

- [ ] **Result**: [Pass/Fail]
- [ ] Blog index displays all available tags
- [ ] Clicking tag navigates to `/blog/tag/[tag]`
- [ ] Tag archive page shows only posts with that tag
- [ ] **Notes**: _Test multiple tags: dev, mdx, react, tutorial, welcome_

### Scenario 5: Performance Metrics

**Test**: Verify performance meets targets (FCP <1.5s, LCP <2.5s)

- [ ] **Result**: [Pass/Fail]
- [ ] Run Lighthouse performance audit
- [ ] Check Network tab for load times
- [ ] Verify no console errors or warnings
- [ ] **Notes**: _Target: Performance score ≥90_

## Acceptance Criteria (MVP - Priority 1)

### US1: MDX Files as Blog Posts

- [ ] MDX files in `content/posts/` render as blog posts at `/blog/[slug]`
- [ ] Frontmatter metadata (title, date, excerpt, tags, author) is parsed and displayed
- [ ] Build fails with clear errors if frontmatter validation fails
- [ ] Test: Create `test-post.mdx`, verify it appears with correct metadata

### US2: Standard Markdown Support

- [ ] Standard Markdown (headings, lists, links, images, code blocks) renders correctly
- [ ] Syntax highlighting works for code blocks with language specification
- [ ] Images use Next.js Image component for optimization
- [ ] Test: Verify all Markdown features in sample posts

### US3: URL and SEO Preservation

- [ ] URL structure `/blog/[slug]` is identical for MDX posts
- [ ] Metadata (title, description, OG tags) matches Ghost CMS structure
- [ ] Test: Compare URL structure and metadata consistency

---

## Visual Validation

- [ ] Layout is clean and professional
- [ ] Colors match brand guidelines (dark mode support)
- [ ] Typography is readable (font families: Inter, sizes, weights)
- [ ] Spacing is consistent (padding, margins follow design tokens)
- [ ] Interactive elements have clear affordances (buttons, links, tags)
- [ ] Responsive design works (mobile: 375px, tablet: 768px, desktop: 1024px+)
- [ ] Code blocks have proper syntax highlighting
- [ ] Callout components have distinct visual styling (info, warning, error, success)
- [ ] Tag badges are readable and clickable

---

## Browser Testing

- [ ] Chrome (latest version)
- [ ] Firefox (latest version)
- [ ] Safari (latest version) - macOS

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Keyboard Navigation

**Screen reader tested**: [NVDA/VoiceOver/JAWS/None]

### Visual

- [ ] Color contrast sufficient (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large)
- [ ] Text can be zoomed to 200% without loss of functionality
- [ ] Touch targets ≥44px for mobile
- [ ] No information conveyed by color alone

## Edge Cases

### Frontmatter Validation

- [ ] Test: Create post with missing `title` → Build fails with clear error
- [ ] Test: Create post with missing `date` → Build fails with clear error
- [ ] Test: Create post with missing `slug` → Build fails with clear error
- [ ] Test: Create post with invalid date format → Build fails with helpful message

### MDX Syntax Errors

- [ ] Test: Create post with invalid JSX → Build fails with line number
- [ ] Test: Create post with unclosed component → Build fails with helpful error
- [ ] Error messages include file name and line number

### Image Handling

- [ ] Test: Reference non-existent image → Graceful error or fallback
- [ ] Test: Large image → Next.js Image optimization works
- [ ] Images have proper width/height attributes
- [ ] Images don't cause layout shift (CLS)
