ISSUES & RECOMMENDATIONS
===============================================================================

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS (Not blockers):
1. Touch target size: ProjectFilters buttons are 32px height, could be 44px+
   - Recommendation: Consider increasing to size="md" (h-10) for mobile-first design
   - Current: Acceptable (32px is commonly used), but not optimal for touch

2. Focus ring offset: 2px offset is good but could be increased to 3px-4px
   - Recommendation: Increase ring-offset to ring-offset-4 for enhanced visibility
   - Current: PASS (2px is adequate)

3. Empty state styling: Could have more prominent visual indicator
   - Recommendation: Add icon or color accent to empty state message
   - Current: PASS (clear messaging is sufficient)
