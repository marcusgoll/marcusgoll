# Specification Quality Checklist: Projects Showcase Page

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: specs/055-projects-showcase/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (0 found)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded (MVP vs P2/P3)
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification

## UI/UX Quality (UI features only)

- [x] CHK017 - Screens inventory defined (design/screens.yaml)
- [x] CHK018 - Copy documented for all screens (design/copy.md)
- [x] CHK019 - Visual references documented (visuals/README.md)
- [x] CHK020 - Accessibility requirements specified (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [x] CHK021 - Performance targets defined (FCP, TTI, LCP, CLS)
- [x] CHK022 - Responsive breakpoints specified

## Notes

âœ… **All checklist items complete**

**Spec Quality**: Comprehensive specification with:
- 7 prioritized user stories (P1/P2/P3)
- 7 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-007)
- 5 non-functional requirements (NFR-001 to NFR-005)
- Detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then
- Clear edge case handling
- Component reuse strategy documented
- MDX data schema defined
- Brand alignment verified

**Artifacts Generated**:
- spec.md (main specification)
- design/screens.yaml (2 screens: projects-grid, project-detail)
- design/copy.md (real content, no Lorem Ipsum)
- visuals/README.md (UX patterns, design tokens, reference sites)
- NOTES.md (research findings, technical decisions)

**Zero Clarifications Needed**: All requirements have reasonable defaults:
- Data source: MDX files (industry standard for content management)
- Image aspect ratio: 16:9 (standard for web screenshots)
- Performance targets: From budgets.md (design system standards)
- Filtering approach: URL query parameters (standard UX pattern)
- Initial project count: 8-12 (reasonable portfolio size)

**Ready for Planning**: No blockers. Spec provides complete context for `/plan` phase.
