## [DEPENDENCY GRAPH]

Story completion order:
1. **Phase 1**: Setup (T001-T003) - Create directory structure, no blockers
2. **Phase 2**: Foundation (T004-T008) - Create reusable lib/components (blocks all stories)
3. **Phase 3**: US1 [P1] (T010-T016) - Projects grid with basic info (independent)
4. **Phase 4**: US2 [P1] (T020-T023) - Category filtering (depends on US1 ProjectCard)
5. **Phase 5**: US3 [P1] (T030-T033) - Featured section (depends on US1 foundation)
6. **Phase 6**: Polish (T040-T048) - Cross-cutting concerns (depends on all MVP stories)

## [PARALLEL EXECUTION OPPORTUNITIES]

- **Phase 2**: T004 [P], T005 [P], T006 [P] (different files, no dependencies)
- **Phase 3**: T012 [P], T013 [P], T014 [P] (independent MDX files)
- **Phase 4**: T020 [P], T021 [P] (filter component + page integration, minimal overlap)
- **Phase 5**: T030 [P], T031 [P] (FeaturedProjectCard + sample data, independent)
- **Phase 6**: T041 [P], T042 [P], T043 [P], T045 [P], T046 [P] (different files/concerns)

## [IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY]

**MVP Scope**: Phase 3, 4, 5 (US1, US2, US3) - Projects grid + filtering + featured section

**Incremental delivery**:
- Sprint 1: US1 â†’ staging validation (basic grid)
- Sprint 2: US2 + US3 â†’ staging validation (filters + featured)
- Sprint 3: US4-US7 (if validated via analytics)

**Testing approach**: Integration tests for data fetching, accessibility tests for keyboard nav, Lighthouse audits for performance
