## Findings

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| T1 | Terminology | MEDIUM | spec.md:198,plan.md:various | Category terminology inconsistency: spec uses "Dev/Startup" but some references use "dev-startup" | Standardize to "dev-startup" in code, "Dev/Startup" in UI |
| C1 | Coverage | LOW | tasks.md | NFR-002 (Accessibility) partially covered - no explicit ARIA label tasks | Tasks T041-T042 cover a11y audits which will address ARIA labels |
| C2 | Coverage | LOW | tasks.md | NFR-003 (SEO) meta tags not explicitly tasked | T011 covers JSON-LD schema, meta tags typically added during page creation (T010) |

## Cross-Artifact Consistency Analysis

### Spec ↔ Plan Consistency

**Architecture Decisions**:
- ✅ Spec requires MDX data source → Plan specifies `lib/projects.ts` with MDX parsing
- ✅ Spec requires responsive grid (1/2/3 columns) → Plan details `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
- ✅ Spec requires category filtering → Plan specifies client-side `ProjectFilters` component with URL params
- ✅ Spec requires featured section → Plan includes `FeaturedProjectCard` component with metrics display
- ✅ Spec requires tech stack badges → Plan creates `TechStackBadge` component with color coding

**Component Reuse**:
- ✅ Spec mentions reusing `PostCard`, `TrackBadge`, `Container`, `Button` → Plan confirms direct reuse with adaptation patterns
- ✅ Spec requires 5 new components → Plan creates exactly 5: ProjectCard, FeaturedProjectCard, TechStackBadge, ProjectFilters, ProjectGrid

**Data Schema**:
- ✅ Spec defines `Project` interface (spec.md:192-211) → Plan uses identical schema (plan.md includes full TypeScript interface)
- ✅ Spec requires category values: Aviation, Dev/Startup, Cross-pollination → Plan uses matching enum (minor terminology variance noted in findings)

### Plan ↔ Tasks Consistency

**File Structure**:
- ✅ Plan specifies `lib/projects.ts` → T004, T005 create this file
- ✅ Plan specifies `components/projects/*.tsx` (5 files) → T006-T008, T030 create these
- ✅ Plan specifies `app/projects/page.tsx` → T010 creates this
- ✅ Plan specifies `content/projects/*.mdx` → T012-T015 create 8 project files

**Component Implementation**:
- ✅ Plan: TechStackBadge (40 LOC) → T006 implements with color scheme prop
- ✅ Plan: ProjectCard (80 LOC) → T007 implements with PostCard pattern adaptation
- ✅ Plan: ProjectGrid (50 LOC) → T008 implements with PostGrid pattern adaptation
- ✅ Plan: ProjectFilters (60 LOC) → T020 implements as client component with URL params
- ✅ Plan: FeaturedProjectCard (100 LOC) → T030 implements with metrics display

**Data Functions**:
- ✅ Plan lists 5 functions → T005 implements: getProjectSlugs(), getProjectBySlug(), getAllProjects(), getFeaturedProjects(), getProjectsByCategory()

### Spec ↔ Tasks Direct Mapping

**FR-001 (MDX Data Source)**:
- ✅ T004: Create Project TypeScript interface

## Dependency Graph Validation

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T001-T003
- ✅ No dependencies, can run in parallel
- ✅ Creates directory structure for subsequent phases

**Phase 2 (Foundation)**: T004-T008
- ✅ Blocks all user story tasks (correctly identified)
- ✅ T004-T008 marked [P] for parallel execution (correct - independent files)

**Phase 3 (US1)**: T010-T016
- ✅ Depends on Phase 2 completion (lib/projects.ts, components)
- ✅ T012, T013, T014 marked [P] (correct - independent MDX files)
- ✅ T010 must precede T016 (page must exist before adding nav link)

**Phase 4 (US2)**: T020-T023
- ✅ Depends on US1 ProjectCard component (T007)
- ✅ T020, T021 marked [P] (reasonable - component + integration can overlap)

**Phase 5 (US3)**: T030-T033
- ✅ Depends on US1 foundation (lib/projects.ts)
- ✅ T030, T031 marked [P] (correct - component + data independent)

**Phase 6 (Polish)**: T040-T048
- ✅ Depends on all MVP phases
- ✅ T041-T046 marked [P] (correct - independent validation tasks)

**No circular dependencies detected** ✅

## Quality Gates Checklist

### Performance Requirements

- ✅ FCP <1.5s target → T045 includes Lighthouse performance audit
- ✅ TTI <3.5s target → T046 validates build-time SSG (no runtime overhead)
- ✅ CLS <0.15 target → T046 ensures images have width/height attributes
- ✅ LCP <3.0s target → T045 tests featured section load time
- ✅ Lighthouse ≥85 → T045 explicit audit task

### Accessibility Requirements

- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA → T041, T042 cover keyboard navigation + focus indicators
- ✅ Screen reader support → T042 includes ARIA label validation
- ✅ Color contrast ≥4.5:1 → Design system already meets this (Navy 900, Emerald 600)
- ✅ Touch targets ≥44x44px → T043 mobile testing validates this

### SEO Requirements

- ✅ Meta tags → T010 page creation includes meta tags
- ✅ JSON-LD schema → T011 explicit task for CollectionPage schema
- ✅ Semantic HTML → T007, T008 use <article>, <section> tags
- ✅ Alt text → T012-T015 MDX frontmatter includes image descriptions

### Maintainability Requirements

- ✅ TypeScript types → T004 creates Project interface with strict validation
- ✅ Component reuse → T006-T008 reuse existing patterns (PostCard, PostGrid, TrackBadge)
- ✅ MDX documentation → T012-T015 include template-based frontmatter
- ✅ Zero new dependencies → Confirmed (gray-matter, next/image already exist)

## Constitution Alignment

**Constitution File**: `.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md`

**MUST Principles**: None defined in constitution

**Brand Mission Alignment**: ✅
- Constitution: "I help pilots advance their aviation careers and teach developers to build with systematic thinking"
- Feature: Projects page explicitly categorizes Aviation vs. Dev/Startup vs. Cross-pollination work
- Reinforces dual-track brand positioning ✅

**Brand Colors Alignment**: ✅
- Aviation: Navy 900 (spec.md:240) matches constitution
- Dev/Startup: Emerald 600 (spec.md:241) matches constitution
- Cross-pollination: Purple (spec.md:242) matches constitution
- Page background: Navy 950 (spec.md:243) matches constitution

**Brand Tone Alignment**: ✅
- Spec avoids marketing fluff ("Systematic Mastery" essence)
- Metrics presented concisely (users, impact, outcome)
- No unsupported superlatives in copy

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas

**None identified** - All critical paths have clear task coverage.

### Medium Risk Areas

1. **Terminology Inconsistency** (Finding T1)
   - **Risk**: Frontend displays "Dev/Startup" but backend uses "dev-startup" causing mismatch
   - **Mitigation**: T004 interface should use kebab-case enum, T007 ProjectCard maps to display names
   - **Impact**: Low (UI layer handles mapping)

### Low Risk Areas

1. **ARIA Labels** (Finding C1)
   - **Risk**: Accessibility audit (T042) may discover missing labels
   - **Mitigation**: Task includes remediation, not just detection
   - **Impact**: Low (caught before production via T042)

2. **Meta Tags** (Finding C2)
   - **Risk**: SEO meta tags might be overlooked during page creation
   - **Mitigation**: T010 references about/page.tsx pattern which includes meta tags
   - **Impact**: Low (Next.js metadata API standard practice)

## Next Actions

**✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

Next: `/implement`

/implement will:
1. Execute tasks from tasks.md (32 tasks across 6 phases)
2. Follow dependency graph (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3-5 → Phase 6)
3. Leverage parallel execution for 26 tasks marked [P]
4. Reference existing patterns (PostCard, PostGrid, lib/posts.ts)
5. Commit after each task completion
6. Update error-log.md if issues arise

**Estimated Duration**: 16-23 hours (per NOTES.md task breakdown)

**Incremental Delivery Strategy**:
- Phase 1-2: Foundation (1-2 hours)
- Phase 3: US1 - Basic grid (4-6 hours) → Can deploy to staging for early feedback
- Phase 4-5: US2-US3 - Filters + Featured (4-6 hours)
- Phase 6: Polish (2-4 hours)

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- Phase 2: T004, T005, T006 (3 tasks)
- Phase 3: T012, T013, T014 (3 tasks)
- Phase 6: T041, T042, T043, T045, T046 (5 tasks)

**Total Parallelizable**: 26 tasks can run in batches for faster implementation
