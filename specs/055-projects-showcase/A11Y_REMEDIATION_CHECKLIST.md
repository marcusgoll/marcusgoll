- [ ] Cross-pollination button background darker (if Option B used)
- [ ] Overall appearance consistent with design

### Step 2: Contrast Verification
Run manual color contrast checks:

```
ProjectCard description:
  Gray-800 on White = 5.11:1 ✓ (AAA)

Aviation filter button:
  Navy-900 on Sky-500 = 4.10:1 ✓ (AA)

Dev/Startup filter button:
  Navy-900 on Emerald-600 = 4.06:1 ✓ (AA)

Cross-pollination filter button:
  Navy-900 on Purple-600 = 3.14:1 (borderline AA)
  OR Navy-900 on Purple-700 = 4.2:1 ✓ (AA)
```

- [ ] All ratios verified
- [ ] All pass WCAG AA threshold

### Step 3: Functionality Testing
- [ ] Tab through filter buttons - all focusable
- [ ] Arrow keys work - left/right navigation
- [ ] Focus ring visible on all buttons
- [ ] Filter changes work - click/Enter activates
- [ ] Screen reader announcement appears - "X filter active, showing Y projects"

### Step 4: Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome/Edge: Styles apply correctly
- [ ] Firefox: Styles apply correctly
- [ ] Safari: Styles apply correctly
- [ ] Mobile (iOS Safari): Touch targets adequate

### Step 5: Accessibility Audit
- [ ] Run Lighthouse accessibility audit
  - Command: DevTools → Lighthouse → Accessibility
  - Target: ≥95/100
- [ ] Expected improvement: ~80 → 95+ (after fixes)

### Step 6: Final Verification
- [ ] All 4 issues resolved
- [ ] No new issues introduced
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- [ ] Ready for production deployment
