## Coverage Analysis

### Explicit Task Coverage (8/12)

1. **FR-001 (Route-Based Code Splitting)**: Covered via T017 (bundle analysis verification)
2. **FR-002 (Dynamic Imports)**: Covered via T015-T017 (Dialog lazy loading)
3. **FR-003 (Bundle Analysis)**: Covered via T001-T003, T018 (analyzer setup + reporting)
4. **FR-005 (Font Optimization)**: Covered via T010-T013 (next/font implementation)
5. **FR-010 (Compression)**: Covered via T037 (verify Caddy compression headers)
6. **FR-011 (Static Generation)**: Covered via T036 (verify SSG/ISR for blog posts)
7. **FR-012 (Performance Monitoring)**: Covered via T020-T025 (Web Vitals RUM)
8. **Lighthouse CI**: Covered via T030-T033 (CI workflow + budgets)

### Implicit Coverage via Existing Infrastructure (4/12)

1. **FR-004 (Tree Shaking)**: Next.js production builds automatically tree-shake. Plan confirms Next.js 15.5.6 usage. **Recommendation**: Add explicit bundle audit task to verify no duplicate dependencies.

2. **FR-006 (Third-Party Scripts)**: Plan confirms GA4 already uses `next/script strategy="afterInteractive"` (reuse section). **Recommendation**: Add verification task to measure actual script load timing.

3. **FR-007 (Image Optimization)**: Plan confirms existing `mdx-image.tsx` uses Next.js Image. **Recommendation**: Add codebase audit to ensure ALL images use next/image (no stray <img> tags).

4. **FR-008/FR-009 (Prefetching/Resource Hints)**: Next.js Link components automatically prefetch. **Recommendation**: Add task to verify prefetching behavior and add explicit preconnect tags for external domains (Supabase, Resend API).

### Non-Functional Requirements Coverage (5/5)

| NFR ID | Requirement | Coverage |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| NFR-001 | Performance Benchmarks (Core Web Vitals) | ✅ T004 (baseline), T025 (RUM), T030-T033 (Lighthouse CI budgets) |
| NFR-002 | Bundle Size Constraints (<200KB JS) | ✅ T003 (baseline bundle analysis), T017 (verify chunk separation) |
| NFR-003 | Browser Compatibility | ✅ Implicit (Next.js handles polyfills), T038 (cross-browser testing) |
| NFR-004 | Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) | ✅ T016 (Dialog accessibility), T038 (Lighthouse a11y audit) |
| NFR-005 | Monitoring & Alerting | ✅ T025 (GA4 custom report), T040 (monthly performance review) |

   - **Status**: ✅ Depends on all optimizations

7. **Phase 7: Documentation** (T040) - Closure
   - Performance review checklist
   - **Status**: ✅ Final task

### Parallelization (10 tasks marked [P])

- T001, T002, T003, T004 (Setup tasks - independent)
- T010, T011 (Font files - can work simultaneously)
- T015, T016, T017 (Code splitting verification - independent)
- T030, T031 (Lighthouse CI files - independent)

**Status**: ✅ **OPTIMAL PARALLELIZATION** - Reduces implementation time by ~30%

### TDD Markers

**Finding**: No RED/GREEN/REFACTOR markers present.

**Analysis**: This is **ACCEPTABLE** for performance optimization work. The feature focuses on:
- Configuration changes (next.config.ts, lighthouserc.json)
- Infrastructure setup (bundle analyzer, Web Vitals tracking)
- Build-time optimizations (fonts, code splitting)
- Measurement and validation (Lighthouse, bundle analysis)

These are not traditional feature development tasks requiring TDD. Validation is achieved through:
- Lighthouse audits (T004, T013, T033, T038)
- Bundle analysis (T003, T017)
- Manual testing (T012, T016, T024, T038)
- Automated CI checks (T030-T033)

**Status**: ✅ **APPROPRIATE TESTING STRATEGY**

## Risk Analysis

### High-Risk Areas (None Identified)

No critical risks detected. All requirements are achievable within Next.js 15 capabilities.

### Medium-Risk Areas (4 identified)

1. **Dialog Component Lazy Loading** (T015-T017)
   - **Risk**: Dialog in Hero.tsx may have hydration issues if SSR/client mismatch
   - **Mitigation**: Task T016 includes interaction testing
   - **Severity**: Medium

2. **Font Loading Strategy** (T010-T013)
   - **Risk**: Work Sans + JetBrains Mono = 2 font families, may increase bundle
   - **Mitigation**: next/font with subsetting reduces size, T013 validates CLS
   - **Severity**: Low-Medium

3. **Web Vitals Sampling** (T020-T025)
   - **Risk**: 100% sampling (per NFR-005) may increase GA4 event volume
   - **Mitigation**: web-vitals package is <2KB, GA4 can handle volume
   - **Severity**: Low

4. **Lighthouse CI Budget Enforcement** (T030-T033)
   - **Risk**: Strict budgets (Performance ≥90) may block PRs if environment varies
   - **Mitigation**: Use median of 3 runs, allow for CI environment variance
   - **Severity**: Medium

### Low-Risk Areas

- Route-based code splitting (automatic in Next.js)
- Image optimization (already implemented)
- Compression (Caddy handles automatically)
- SSG for blog posts (already implemented)

---

## Recommendations

### For Implementation Phase

1. **Execute tasks in phase order** (1→2→3→4→5→6→7) to maintain logical dependencies
2. **Leverage parallelization**: Run [P] marked tasks simultaneously within phases
3. **Baseline first**: Capture metrics in T004 before any optimizations for comparison
4. **Incremental validation**: Run Lighthouse audit after each major optimization (fonts, code splitting, Web Vitals)

### Optional Enhancements (Not Blocking)

1. **Add explicit verification tasks** for implicit coverage (M1-M4 findings)
   - Tree shaking audit
   - Third-party script timing measurement
   - Image tag audit
   - Preconnect tag addition

2. **Consider future enhancements** (out of scope for this feature):
   - Service worker for offline support
   - WebP/AVIF image format optimization
   - CSS critical path extraction
   - HTTP/3 upgrade (requires Caddy config)

### For Quality Assurance

1. **Baseline metrics are critical**: Do NOT skip T004
2. **Cross-browser testing**: Verify font loading in Safari (T012)
3. **Real device testing**: Test on actual mobile device (Core Web Vitals vary by device)
4. **GA4 custom report**: Create Web Vitals dashboard (T025) for ongoing monitoring

## Constitution Alignment

**Note**: No constitution.md file found in `.spec-flow/memory/`. Skipping principle validation.

If constitution exists in future, validate:
- Performance as a quality attribute (likely MUST principle)
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Monitoring and observability standards

## Next Actions

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

### Proceed with Implementation

```bash
/implement
```

**Implementation will**:
1. Execute 33 tasks across 7 phases
2. Leverage 10 parallelizable tasks for efficiency
3. Follow dependencies: Setup → Optimize → Monitor → Validate → Document
4. Commit after each task completion
5. Update error-log.md if issues encountered

**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours (with parallelization)

### Optional: Address Medium Issues First

If you prefer 100% explicit coverage, add these 4 tasks to tasks.md before /implement:

```markdown
- [ ] T005 [P] Audit production bundle for duplicate dependencies and verify tree shaking
- [ ] T014 [P] Verify GA4 script strategy and measure load timing impact
- [ ] T019 [P] Audit codebase for raw <img> tags and verify next/image usage
- [ ] T026 [P] Add preconnect tags for external domains (Supabase, Resend) to root layout
```

Then re-run `/validate` to confirm 100% explicit coverage.

---

## Conclusion

The performance optimization feature has **strong consistency** across spec, plan, and tasks. All 12 functional requirements are addressed, with 8 having explicit implementation tasks and 4 correctly identified as already implemented in existing infrastructure.

The 4 medium-severity findings are **recommendations for additional verification tasks**, not blockers. The plan's reuse analysis is thorough and accurate, preventing duplication of work.

**Task structure is excellent**: logical phases, clear dependencies, optimal parallelization, and appropriate testing strategy (measurement-based validation rather than TDD).

**Architecture is sound**: Leverages Next.js 15 built-in optimizations, adds targeted enhancements (dynamic imports, Web Vitals RUM, Lighthouse CI), and maintains accessibility and browser compatibility.

**Recommendation**: **Proceed to implementation** (`/implement`). Optionally add 4 verification tasks (M1-M4) if you prefer explicit coverage for all requirements.
