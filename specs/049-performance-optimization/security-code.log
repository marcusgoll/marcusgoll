CODE SECURITY SCAN - Feature 049 Performance Optimization
============================================================================
Date: 2025-10-28
Feature: specs/049-performance-optimization

FILES SCANNED:
1. app/fonts.ts
2. lib/web-vitals-tracking.ts
3. components/providers/WebVitalsReporter.tsx
4. lib/analytics.ts (related file)

SECURITY CHECKS PERFORMED:

1. HARDCODED SECRETS SCAN
   ✅ No API keys found
   ✅ No passwords found
   ✅ No secret tokens found
   ✅ No connection strings found

2. CONSOLE.LOG LEAK DETECTION
   Status: PASSED (debug mode only)
   
   Findings:
   - lib/analytics.ts:
     * Lines 69, 89, 110, 134, 158, 178, 193, 229
     * Type: console.debug() statements
     * Risk: LOW - Debug mode only, not production logs
     * Data: Only non-sensitive metadata (track, location, metrics)
     * Recommendation: These are intentional debug logs, not data leaks
   
   - app/fonts.ts: ✅ No console statements
   - lib/web-vitals-tracking.ts: ✅ No console statements
   - components/providers/WebVitalsReporter.tsx: ✅ No console statements

3. GA4 INTEGRATION SECURITY
   ✅ PII Protection Verified
   
   Analytics Data Sent to GA4:
   - Content track names (aviation, dev-startup, etc.)
   - Location identifiers (sidebar, footer, inline)
   - Web Vitals metrics (CLS, FCP, LCP, TTFB, INP)
   - Page paths
   
   PII Compliance:
   ✅ No email addresses sent (line 131: has_email: 'yes'/'no' only)
   ✅ No user identifiers
   ✅ No personal information
   ✅ Only anonymous performance metrics
   
   Security Measures:
   - isGtagAvailable() check prevents server-side execution
   - window.gtag type safety
   - Client-side only execution (WebVitalsReporter uses 'use client')

4. DATA EXPOSURE RISKS
   ✅ No sensitive data in Web Vitals tracking
   ✅ No user identification in metrics
   ✅ No business logic exposure
   ✅ Metrics are anonymized performance data only

5. CLIENT-SIDE EXECUTION SAFETY
   ✅ WebVitalsReporter properly marked 'use client'
   ✅ window availability checked before execution
   ✅ No server-side data leakage risk

VULNERABILITIES FOUND: 0 Critical, 0 High, 0 Medium, 0 Low

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Consider removing console.debug in production builds (optional)
   - Currently low risk as these are debug-level logs
   - Production typically disables console.debug automatically
   
2. Monitor GA4 for unintentional PII collection (ongoing)
   - Current implementation: COMPLIANT
   - Regular audits recommended

VERDICT: PASSED
- No hardcoded secrets
- No data leak risks
- GA4 integration is PII-compliant
- Console statements are debug-level only
- All security best practices followed
