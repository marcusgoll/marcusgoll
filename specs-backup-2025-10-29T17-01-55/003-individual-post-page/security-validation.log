Status: CLEAN - No vulnerabilities detected


Code Security Analysis:
-----------------------

1. XSS Prevention:
   ✓ SECURE - dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage is limited and safe:
     - breadcrumbs.tsx:46 - JSON.stringify() output for Schema.org (safe)
     - app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx:154 - JSON.stringify() output for Schema.org (safe)
   ✓ No direct innerHTML/outerHTML manipulation detected
   ✓ All user content rendered via React (auto-escaped)
   ✓ MDX content processed through next-mdx-remote with safe defaults

2. Input Sanitization:
   ✓ SECURE - URL parameter handling:
     - Slug parameter extracted from Next.js route params (framework sanitized)
     - getPostBySlug() validates slug against filesystem (path.join prevents traversal)
     - Returns null for invalid slugs, triggering 404 via notFound()
   ✓ SECURE - Social share URL encoding:
     - social-share.tsx:75-76 - encodeURIComponent() applied to URL and title
     - Prevents injection in social media share URLs

3. Injection Risks:
   ✓ No SQL injection risk (static file-based CMS, no database)
   ✓ No command injection (no shell execution)
   ✓ Path traversal prevented by path.join() normalization in getPostBySlug()
   ✓ No eval() or Function() constructor usage

4. External Link Security:
   ✓ SECURE - All external links include rel="noopener noreferrer":
     - social-share.tsx:86 (Twitter share)
     - social-share.tsx:100 (LinkedIn share)
   ✓ Prevents tabnabbing attacks and referrer leakage

5. Clipboard API Security:
   ✓ SECURE - Clipboard usage in social-share.tsx:
     - navigator.clipboard.writeText() only writes provided URL (no sensitive data)
     - Fallback document.execCommand('copy') uses temporary textarea (removed after use)
     - No reading from clipboard
     - Error handling prevents information leakage

6. Schema.org JSON-LD Injection:
   ✓ SECURE - JSON-LD generation:
     - lib/schema.ts:60-94 - BlogPosting schema uses JSON.stringify()
     - lib/schema.ts:105-118 - BreadcrumbList schema uses JSON.stringify()
     - All data from validated frontmatter (gray-matter library)
     - No user-controlled input in schema generation

7. Component-Specific Security:

   a) social-share.tsx:
      ✓ Props validated by TypeScript (url: string, title: string)
      ✓ URL encoding applied before external navigation
      ✓ Native Web Share API usage is safe (browser-controlled)

   b) table-of-contents.tsx:
      ✓ DOM queries limited to article element
      ✓ Heading IDs generated from textContent (sanitized by regex)
      ✓ IntersectionObserver usage is safe
      ✓ Smooth scroll uses element.getBoundingClientRect() (safe)

   c) breadcrumbs.tsx:
      ✓ Segments passed as props (server-controlled)
      ✓ No user input in breadcrumb generation
      ✓ Schema generation uses validated data

   d) related-posts.tsx:
      ✓ Server component - data fetched at build time
      ✓ No client-side state or user input
      ✓ PostCard component renders validated data

   e) app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx:
      ✓ Server component - static generation at build time
      ✓ Slug validation via getPostBySlug() (returns null for invalid)
      ✓ notFound() called for invalid posts
      ✓ Metadata generation uses validated frontmatter
      ✓ No direct user input rendering

8. Security Best Practices:
   ✓ TypeScript strict mode enforced (type safety)
   ✓ Server Components used where possible (reduced attack surface)
   ✓ Client Components marked explicitly ('use client')
   ✓ Next.js built-in XSS protection active
   ✓ Content Security Policy headers should be configured (deployment concern)


Issues Found:
-------------
None - All code follows secure coding practices


Recommendations:
----------------
1. OPTIONAL - Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers in next.config.js:
   - Restrict script-src to 'self' and trusted CDNs
   - Add unsafe-inline only for JSON-LD scripts
   - Configure frame-ancestors to prevent clickjacking

2. OPTIONAL - Add rate limiting for Web Share API (prevent abuse):
   - Consider debouncing share button clicks
   - Low priority (browser already provides user consent)

3. OPTIONAL - Add HTTPS enforcement in production:
   - Verify Next.js deployment enforces HTTPS
   - Add Strict-Transport-Security header

4. COMPLETED - Regular dependency audits:
   - Continue running npm audit before deployments
   - Keep dependencies updated


Security Checklist:
-------------------
[✓] Input sanitization: URL params validated via framework
[✓] XSS prevention: React auto-escaping + safe dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage
[✓] Safe external links: rel="noopener noreferrer" present on all target="_blank"
[✓] Clipboard API: Secure write-only usage without sensitive data exposure
[✓] No SQL injection: Static file-based CMS
[✓] No command injection: No shell execution
[✓] Path traversal prevention: path.join() normalization
[✓] Type safety: TypeScript strict mode
[✓] Minimal attack surface: Server Components prioritized
[✓] Dependency security: Zero vulnerabilities


Status: PASSED
===============

Summary: All 6 components reviewed demonstrate secure coding practices. No
critical, high, or moderate security vulnerabilities detected in dependencies
