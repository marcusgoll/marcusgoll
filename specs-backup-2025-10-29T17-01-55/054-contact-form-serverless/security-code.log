SECURITY CODE ANALYSIS - Contact Form Feature
==============================================
Analysis Date: 2025-10-29
Feature: 054-contact-form-serverless
Files Analyzed: 4

SCOPE
-----
- app/api/contact/route.ts (API endpoint)
- lib/contact/turnstile-verifier.ts (Turnstile verification)
- lib/contact/email-templates.ts (Email generation)
- lib/contact/validation-schema.ts (Input validation)

SECURITY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED
==============================

1. INPUT VALIDATION (Zod Schema)
   ✓ Status: PASSED
   - Name: 1-100 characters (required)
   - Email: Valid email format validation (required)
   - Subject: Enum validation (6 predefined options)
   - Message: 500-10,000 characters (prevents low-effort spam)
   - Turnstile token: Required (non-empty string)
   - Honeypot field: Must be empty (anti-bot validation)
   - Implementation: lib/contact/validation-schema.ts (lines 35-54)

2. RATE LIMITING
   ✓ Status: PASSED
   - Limit: 3 submissions per 15 minutes per IP
   - Tracks: Client IP from multiple proxy headers (x-forwarded-for, x-real-ip, cf-connecting-ip)
   - Response: 429 status with Retry-After headers
   - Implementation: app/api/contact/route.ts (lines 66-91)
   - Rate limiter: lib/newsletter/rate-limiter.ts (reused)

3. TURNSTILE VERIFICATION (CAPTCHA)
   ✓ Status: PASSED
   - Provider: Cloudflare Turnstile
   - Token verification: Server-side API call to challenges.cloudflare.com
   - Timeout: 5 seconds (AbortSignal.timeout)
   - Client IP validation: Passed to Turnstile for better accuracy
   - Error handling: Graceful failures with generic error messages
   - Implementation: lib/contact/turnstile-verifier.ts (lines 33-125)

4. HONEYPOT FIELD (Anti-Spam)
   ✓ Status: PASSED
   - Field name: "honeypot" (hidden from users, attractive to bots)
   - Validation: Must be empty string
   - Rejection strategy: Silent rejection (don't reveal anti-spam mechanism)
   - Logging: Logs honeypot triggers with IP for monitoring
   - Implementation: app/api/contact/route.ts (lines 113-124)

5. XSS PREVENTION
   ✓ Status: PASSED
   - HTML escaping: All user input escaped before rendering in emails
   - Escape function: Replaces &, <, >, ", ' with HTML entities
   - Escaped fields: name, email, subject, message
   - Implementation: lib/contact/email-templates.ts (lines 231-238)
   - Usage: Lines 63-70 (admin email), lines 144, 194 (auto-reply)

6. EMAIL INJECTION PREVENTION
   ✓ Status: PASSED
   - Email validation: Zod email() validator checks format
   - No header injection: Reply-To field uses validated email
   - No direct string interpolation: Uses Resend SDK (handles sanitization)
   - Implementation: app/api/contact/route.ts (lines 163-170)

7. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SECURITY
   ✓ Status: PASSED
   - No hardcoded secrets: All secrets from process.env
   - Secrets used:
     * RESEND_API_KEY (server-only)
     * TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY (server-only)
     * CONTACT_ADMIN_EMAIL (server-only)
     * NEWSLETTER_FROM_EMAIL (server-only)
   - Fallback values: Safe defaults for non-sensitive config
   - Configuration checks: Validates env vars before proceeding

8. ERROR HANDLING
   ✓ Status: PASSED
   - Generic error messages: Don't expose internal details to users
   - Detailed logging: Server-side console logs for debugging
   - Status codes: Appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 429, 500)
   - Non-critical failures: Auto-reply failure doesn't break submission
   - Implementation: app/api/contact/route.ts (lines 211-221)

9. IP EXTRACTION SECURITY
   ✓ Status: PASSED
   - Multiple header checks: x-forwarded-for, x-real-ip, cf-connecting-ip
   - First IP extraction: Takes first IP from x-forwarded-for (prevents spoofing)
   - Fallback: Returns "unknown" if no IP found (safe default)
   - Implementation: lib/newsletter/rate-limiter.ts (lines 86-106)

SECURITY ANALYSIS RESULTS
==========================

CRITICAL ISSUES: 0
HIGH ISSUES: 0
MEDIUM ISSUES: 0
LOW ISSUES: 0
INFORMATIONAL: 2

INFORMATIONAL FINDINGS
----------------------

1. Rate Limiter In-Memory Storage
   - Severity: Informational
   - Description: Rate limiter uses in-memory Map (not Redis)
   - Impact: Rate limits reset on server restart; not shared across instances
   - Mitigation: Acceptable for serverless (single-instance per region)
   - Recommendation: Consider Redis for multi-instance deployments
   - Location: lib/newsletter/rate-limiter.ts (line 12)

2. Error Message Consistency
   - Severity: Informational
   - Description: Turnstile and honeypot failures use different generic messages
   - Impact: None (both reject appropriately)
   - Observation: "Security verification failed" vs "An error occurred"
   - Recommendation: Consider consistent message to reduce fingerprinting
   - Location: app/api/contact/route.ts (lines 120, 137)

SECURITY BEST PRACTICES VERIFIED
=================================

✓ Input validation with strict schemas
✓ Rate limiting per IP address
✓ Multi-layer spam protection (Turnstile + honeypot)
✓ XSS prevention via HTML escaping
✓ Email injection prevention
✓ No hardcoded secrets
✓ Secure error handling (generic messages)
✓ Server-side verification of all security tokens
✓ Timeout protection on external API calls
✓ Safe IP extraction from proxy headers

CODE REVIEW SUMMARY
===================

Security Posture: EXCELLENT
Code Quality: HIGH
Documentation: COMPREHENSIVE
Test Coverage: Not assessed (manual code review only)

The contact form implementation follows security best practices with:
- Defense in depth (multiple layers of spam protection)
- Principle of least privilege (minimal data exposure)
- Secure by default (validation at every layer)
- Clear error handling without information leakage

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

1. HIGH PRIORITY: None
2. MEDIUM PRIORITY: None
3. LOW PRIORITY:
   - Add integration tests for security features
   - Consider Redis for production rate limiting (if multi-instance)
   - Add Content-Security-Policy headers to contact page
   - Monitor Turnstile verification success rate

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: PASSED ✓

The contact form feature demonstrates strong security implementation with
no critical or high-severity issues. All security requirements from the
specification (NFR-004, NFR-005, NFR-006) are properly implemented.
