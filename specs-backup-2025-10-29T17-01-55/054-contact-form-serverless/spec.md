# Feature Specification: Contact Form (Serverless)

**Branch**: `feature/054-contact-form-serverless`
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Draft
**GitHub Issue**: #12 (ICE Score: 1.80)

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Story

Site visitors need a way to contact Marcus directly without exposing his personal email address publicly. The form should be easy to use, protected against spam, and reliably deliver messages.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a visitor wants to contact Marcus, **When** they navigate to /contact, **Then** they see a contact form with fields for name, email, subject dropdown, and message textarea
2. **Given** a visitor fills out the form completely and correctly, **When** they submit the form with valid Turnstile challenge, **Then** the message is sent to Marcus's admin email AND the sender receives an auto-reply confirmation
3. **Given** a visitor submits the form, **When** the submission succeeds, **Then** they see a success message with expected response time and the form clears
4. **Given** a bot attempts to submit the form, **When** the honeypot field is filled OR Turnstile validation fails, **Then** the submission is silently rejected without revealing anti-spam mechanisms
5. **Given** a user tries to spam the form, **When** they exceed 3 submissions in 15 minutes from the same IP, **Then** they receive a "Too many requests" error with retry-after information

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the email service (Resend) is down?
  â†’ Display user-friendly error message, log error server-side for monitoring
- How does the system handle extremely long messages (>10,000 characters)?
  â†’ Frontend validation prevents submission, backend validation truncates and warns
- What if a user submits the form without JavaScript enabled?
  â†’ Progressive enhancement: form still works but without client-side validation and Turnstile (honeypot still protects)
- How is PII (sender email, IP address) handled?
  â†’ Email masked in logs, IP only used for rate limiting (not stored permanently)

## User Stories (Prioritized)

### Story Prioritization

**Priority 1 (MVP) ðŸŽ¯**

- **US1** [P1]: As a site visitor, I want to submit a message to Marcus with my name, email, subject, and detailed message so that I can reach him without exposing his email address
  - **Acceptance**: Form with 4 required fields (name, email, subject dropdown, message textarea 500+ chars) submits successfully and shows confirmation
  - **Independent test**: Form submission sends email to admin and auto-reply to sender
  - **Effort**: M (6 hours)

- **US2** [P1]: As Marcus, I want contact submissions to be protected from spam bots so that I only receive legitimate messages
  - **Acceptance**: Cloudflare Turnstile challenge + honeypot field blocks bot submissions (>95% spam rejection rate)
  - **Independent test**: Bot submissions with filled honeypot or failed Turnstile are rejected with 400 status
  - **Effort**: M (5 hours)

- **US3** [P1]: As a site visitor, I want clear validation errors if I submit invalid data so that I can correct my message
  - **Acceptance**: Client-side validation (Zod) shows inline errors for email format, message length (500 char min), required fields
  - **Independent test**: Invalid submissions show specific error messages without sending email
  - **Effort**: S (3 hours)

**Priority 2 (Enhancement)**

- **US4** [P2]: As Marcus, I want to prevent form spam via rate limiting so that the same IP cannot flood my inbox
  - **Acceptance**: 3 submissions per 15 minutes per IP, 429 response with Retry-After header
  - **Depends on**: US1
  - **Effort**: S (3 hours)

- **US5** [P2]: As a sender, I want to receive an auto-reply confirmation so that I know my message was delivered successfully
  - **Acceptance**: Auto-reply email sent to sender with timestamp, expected response time, and message copy
  - **Depends on**: US1
  - **Effort**: S (2 hours)

**Priority 3 (Nice-to-have)**

- **US6** [P3]: As Marcus, I want contact messages stored in a database so that I can view submission history and analytics
  - **Acceptance**: Messages saved to PostgreSQL with metadata (IP, timestamp, Turnstile score)
  - **Depends on**: US1
  - **Effort**: M (4 hours)

- **US7** [P3]: As a site visitor, I want accessible keyboard navigation and screen reader support so that I can submit the form without a mouse
  - **Acceptance**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, full keyboard nav, ARIA labels, axe audit passes
  - **Depends on**: US1
  - **Effort**: S (3 hours)

**Effort Scale**:
- XS: <2 hours
- S: 2-4 hours
- M: 4-8 hours (Â½ day)
- L: 8-16 hours (1-2 days)
- XL: 16+ hours (>2 days, consider breaking down)

**MVP Strategy**: Ship US1-US3 first (core form with spam protection), validate delivery works reliably, then add US4-US5 (rate limiting + auto-reply), defer US6-US7 to later iterations based on feedback.

## Context Strategy & Signal Design

- **System prompt altitude**: Mid-level - API route handler with validation, email service integration, spam protection
- **Tool surface**: NextRequest/NextResponse (Next.js), Zod validation, Resend SDK, Turnstile verification API
- **Examples in scope**: Newsletter subscribe route (app/api/newsletter/subscribe/route.ts), email service (lib/newsletter/email-service.ts), rate limiter (lib/newsletter/rate-limiter.ts)
- **Context budget**: 15,000 tokens (specification + implementation examples)
- **Retrieval strategy**: JIT - Load email service and rate limiter patterns during implementation
- **Memory artifacts**: NOTES.md tracks environment variables, API patterns, spam protection decisions
- **Compaction cadence**: After spec validation, preserve core requirements and API contracts
- **Sub-agents**: None (single-file implementation for API route + form component)

## Requirements

### Functional (testable only)

**Form Fields**:
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a contact form with 4 required fields: name (text, max 100 chars), email (email format), subject (dropdown with predefined topics), message (textarea, min 500 chars, max 10,000 chars)
- **FR-002**: Subject dropdown MUST include options: "General Inquiry", "Aviation Consulting", "Dev/Startup Collaboration", "CFI Training Resources", "Speaking/Workshop Request", "Other"
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate email format using standard RFC 5322 regex pattern

**Spam Protection**:
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement Cloudflare Turnstile invisible challenge before form submission
- **FR-005**: System MUST include a honeypot field (CSS hidden, name="website") that rejects submissions if filled
- **FR-006**: System MUST rate limit submissions to 3 requests per 15 minutes per IP address using existing rate-limiter pattern (lib/newsletter/rate-limiter.ts)

**Email Handling**:
- **FR-007**: System MUST send contact message to admin email (configurable via CONTACT_ADMIN_EMAIL environment variable, defaults to marcus@marcusgoll.com)
- **FR-008**: Admin email MUST include: sender name, sender email, subject, message, submission timestamp (ISO 8601), sender IP address (for abuse tracking)
- **FR-009**: System MUST send auto-reply email to sender with: confirmation message, expected response time ("Marcus typically responds within 2-3 business days"), copy of original message, contact page link
- **FR-010**: All emails MUST use Resend service with FROM address from NEWSLETTER_FROM_EMAIL environment variable
- **FR-011**: System MUST mask sender email in server logs using existing maskEmail utility (lib/newsletter/email-service.ts pattern)

**Success/Error Handling**:
- **FR-012**: System MUST return 200 OK with {success: true, message: "Message sent successfully"} on successful submission
- **FR-013**: System MUST return 400 Bad Request with {success: false, message: string} for validation failures (with specific field errors from Zod)
- **FR-014**: System MUST return 429 Too Many Requests with Retry-After header for rate limit violations
- **FR-015**: System MUST return 500 Internal Server Error with generic message "Unable to send message" if email service fails (detailed error logged server-side only)
- **FR-016**: Frontend MUST display success message for 5 seconds, clear form fields, and show "Send another message" option
- **FR-017**: Frontend MUST display inline validation errors below each field with clear instructions to fix

**Data Validation**:
- **FR-018**: System MUST use Zod schema for type-safe validation of all request fields (name, email, subject, message, turnstileToken)
- **FR-019**: Message field MUST enforce minimum 500 characters to prevent low-effort spam
- **FR-020**: System MUST sanitize HTML/script tags from all text inputs to prevent XSS attacks

### Non-Functional

- **NFR-001**: Performance: API route MUST respond within 3 seconds for successful submissions (p95)
- **NFR-002**: Performance: Email delivery MUST be non-blocking (async fire-and-forget pattern, don't wait for Resend response)
- **NFR-003**: Accessibility: Form MUST meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (4.5:1 contrast, keyboard nav, ARIA labels, screen reader tested)
- **NFR-004**: Mobile: Form MUST be fully responsive on screens 375px width and up (iPhone SE minimum)
- **NFR-005**: Error Handling: User-facing errors MUST be clear and actionable ("Email format invalid" not "Zod validation error")
- **NFR-006**: Security: Turnstile secret key MUST be server-side only, never exposed to client
- **NFR-007**: Security: Rate limiter MUST use IP address from x-forwarded-for header (Caddy proxy)
- **NFR-008**: Privacy: Sender IP address MUST NOT be stored permanently (only used for rate limiting, cleared after 15 minutes)
- **NFR-009**: Logging: All successful submissions MUST log to console with masked email: `[Contact] Message sent from m***@example.com (subject: Aviation Consulting)`
- **NFR-010**: Reliability: System MUST handle Resend API failures gracefully without crashing (catch errors, log, return 500)

### Key Entities (if data involved)

**ContactMessage** (optional, for future database storage - US6):
- **Purpose**: Store contact form submissions for analytics and history
- **Attributes**: id (UUID), sender_name (string), sender_email (string, encrypted), subject (string), message (text), ip_address (string, hashed), turnstile_score (float, 0-1), created_at (timestamp)
- **Relationships**: None (standalone entity)
- **Migration**: Deferred to US6 (MVP uses email-only, no database)

## Deployment Considerations

### Platform Dependencies

**Vercel** (marketing/app):
- None - Standard Next.js API route pattern, no edge runtime changes

**Railway** (API):
- N/A (self-hosted VPS, not using Railway)

**Dependencies**:
- Cloudflare Turnstile client library: @cloudflare/turnstile (new dependency, <5KB gzipped)
- All other dependencies already in package.json (Next.js, Zod, Resend)

### Environment Variables

**New Required Variables**:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`: Cloudflare Turnstile site key for client-side widget (staging: test key, production: production key)
- `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`: Cloudflare Turnstile secret key for server-side verification (staging: test key, production: production key)
- `CONTACT_ADMIN_EMAIL`: Admin email address to receive contact form submissions (staging: test@marcusgoll.com, production: marcus@marcusgoll.com)

**Existing Variables** (already configured):
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Already in use for newsletter (no changes needed)
- `NEWSLETTER_FROM_EMAIL`: Reuse for contact form FROM address (no changes needed)
- `PUBLIC_URL`: Already in use for email links (no changes needed)

**Schema Update Required**: Yes - Update .env.example with new Turnstile and admin email variables

### Breaking Changes

**API Contract Changes**:
- No breaking changes (new endpoint: POST /api/contact)

**Database Schema Changes**:
- No schema changes for MVP (database storage deferred to US6)

**Auth Flow Modifications**:
- No auth changes (contact form is public, no authentication required)

**Client Compatibility**:
- Backward compatible (new feature, no existing functionality affected)

### Migration Requirements

**Database Migrations**:
- Not required for MVP (email-only implementation)

**Data Backfill**:
- Not required

**RLS Policy Changes**:
- Not applicable (no database storage in MVP)

**Reversibility**:
- Fully reversible (delete /app/api/contact/route.ts, remove /app/contact page, revert .env.example)

### Rollback Considerations

**Standard Rollback**:
- Yes: 3-command rollback via git revert (feature is additive, no breaking changes)

**Special Rollback Needs**:
- None (new feature, doesn't modify existing functionality)

**Deployment Metadata**:
- Deploy IDs tracked in specs/054-contact-form-serverless/NOTES.md (Deployment Metadata section)

## Screens Inventory (UI Features Only)

Screens to design:
1. **contact-form**: Contact form page - Primary action: "Send Message"
   - States: `default` (empty form), `validating` (client-side validation), `submitting` (API call in progress), `success` (message sent confirmation), `error` (validation or server error), `rate-limited` (429 response)
   - Components: FormField (input + label + error), Textarea, Select dropdown, Button (primary CTA), Turnstile widget (invisible), Alert (success/error messages)

2. **contact-success**: Success confirmation screen - Primary action: "Send Another Message"
   - States: `default` (success message displayed)
   - Components: Alert (success), Button (secondary CTA to reset form)

See `.spec-flow/templates/screens-yaml-template.yaml` for full screen definitions.

## Measurement Plan

> **Purpose**: Define how success will be measured using Claude Code-accessible sources.
> **Sources**: Structured logs, Resend webhook logs (future), Lighthouse CI.

### Data Collection

**Structured Logs** (server-side):
- `logger.info({ event: "contact.submitted", subject, ip_hash, timestamp })`
- `logger.error({ event: "contact.failed", error, email_masked })`
- `logger.warn({ event: "contact.rate_limited", ip_hash, retry_after })`

**Key Events to Track**:
1. `contact.page_view` - Visitors viewing contact page
2. `contact.form_started` - User focuses first field (engagement)
3. `contact.form_submitted` - Form submission attempt
4. `contact.success` - Successful message delivery
5. `contact.validation_error` - Client-side validation failure
6. `contact.spam_blocked` - Honeypot or Turnstile rejection
7. `contact.rate_limited` - Rate limit exceeded

### Measurement Queries

**Logs** (`logs/contact/*.jsonl`):
- Success rate: `grep '"event":"contact.success"' | wc -l / grep '"event":"contact.submitted"' | wc -l * 100`
- Spam block rate: `grep '"event":"contact.spam_blocked"' | wc -l / grep '"event":"contact.submitted"' | wc -l * 100`
- Average response time: `jq -r 'select(.event=="contact.success") | .duration' | awk '{sum+=$1; n++} END {print sum/n}'`

**Resend Dashboard** (manual check):
- Email delivery rate (admin + auto-reply emails)
- Bounce rate (invalid sender emails)

**Lighthouse** (`.lighthouseci/results/*.json`):
- Accessibility score for /contact page (target: â‰¥95)
- Performance: FCP <1.5s, TTI <3.5s
