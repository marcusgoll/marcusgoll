## Detailed Findings

### F001 - Environment Variable Documentation Completeness
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Category**: Documentation
**Location**: `spec.md` lines 404-410, `plan.md` lines 64-68

**Issue**: Spec mentions two new environment variables (MAINTENANCE_MODE, MAINTENANCE_BYPASS_TOKEN) but .env.example update is delegated to tasks rather than explicitly documented in spec's "Environment Variables" section.

**Evidence**:
- Spec lines 404-410 list new env vars under "Dependencies" heading
- Plan lines 64-68 show exact format but not linked from spec
- Tasks.md T003 handles .env.example update

**Impact**: Developer onboarding may miss environment variable setup if only reading spec.

**Recommendation**: Add explicit .env.example snippet to spec.md Dependencies section showing exact format.

**Resolution**: Non-blocking - Tasks T003/T004 will create proper .env documentation.

---

### F002 - Middleware Config Export Pattern Not Specified
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Category**: Specification Gap
**Location**: `spec.md` FR-005 (lines 231-254), `plan.md` Module 1 (lines 176-203)

**Issue**: Spec FR-005 describes middleware behavior but doesn't explicitly specify the `config` export with matcher pattern, which is critical for Next.js Edge Middleware.

**Evidence**:
- Spec FR-005 (line 234-253): Describes exclusion paths but not the Next.js config export
- Plan Module 1 (line 195): Shows `export const config = { matcher: [...] }`
- Tasks T009 mentions config but no test task validates matcher

**Impact**: Implementer might miss the config export, causing middleware to run on all routes (including static assets), degrading performance.

**Recommendation**: Add explicit "Middleware Configuration" subsection to FR-005 specifying the config export pattern.

**Resolution**: Non-blocking - Plan clearly documents this, tasks T009 includes it.

---

### F003 - Token Masking Implementation Detail Missing from Spec
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Category**: Underspecification
**Location**: `spec.md` FR-006 (lines 257-274), `plan.md` Module 3 (lines 233-255)

**Issue**: Spec FR-006 describes "masked token (last 4 chars only)" but doesn't specify the masking format (e.g., `***abcd` vs `****abcd` vs `[MASKED]abcd`).

**Evidence**:
- Spec line 263: "Token: ***<last 4 chars>" (implies format but not explicit)
- Plan line 247: `maskToken(token: string): string` function defined
- No test acceptance criteria for exact masking format

**Impact**: Different implementers might use different masking formats, causing inconsistent logs.

**Recommendation**: Specify exact format in FR-006: `***{last_4_chars}` (e.g., `***a1b2` for 64-char token).

**Resolution**: Non-blocking - Convention is clear from context, tasks T006 will test this.

---

### F004 - Accessibility Testing Scope Not Fully Defined
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Category**: Test Coverage
**Location**: `spec.md` lines 75-78 (Scenario 1), `tasks.md` T026 (lines 350-355)

**Issue**: Spec mentions "WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards" but doesn't enumerate specific checks (e.g., form labels, focus management, screen reader announcements).

**Evidence**:
- Spec line 77: "Page meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards" (high-level)
- Tasks T026: Lists contrast ratio, keyboard nav, semantic HTML but not exhaustive
- No acceptance criteria for specific WCAG success criteria numbers

**Impact**: Axe DevTools scan might pass but miss manual checks (e.g., screen reader flow, focus traps).

**Recommendation**: Add explicit WCAG success criteria to test (e.g., 1.4.3 Contrast, 2.1.1 Keyboard, 4.1.2 Name/Role/Value).

**Resolution**: Non-blocking - T026 covers primary checks, Axe scan will catch most issues.

---

### F005 - Terminology Drift: "Maintenance Page" vs "Maintenance Mode"
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Category**: Terminology Consistency
**Location**: Multiple files

**Issue**: Minor terminology inconsistency between "maintenance page" (the UI) and "maintenance mode" (the feature state). Sometimes used interchangeably.

**Evidence**:
- Spec title: "Maintenance Mode with Secret Bypass" (feature)
- Spec Scenario 1 title: "External Visitor During Maintenance" (ambiguous)
- Plan Module 2: "Maintenance Page" (UI component)
- Tasks Phase 4: "US1 [P3] - External Visitor Sees Maintenance Page" (UI focus)

**Impact**: Minor confusion when discussing feature vs component in code review.

**Recommendation**: Establish convention:
- "Maintenance mode" = feature toggle (MAINTENANCE_MODE environment variable)
- "Maintenance page" = UI component (app/maintenance/page.tsx)

**Resolution**: Non-blocking - Context makes meaning clear, no technical ambiguity.

---

### F006 - Missing Lighthouse Performance Baseline
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Category**: Test Baseline
**Location**: `spec.md` NFR-002 (lines 292-306), `tasks.md` T025 (lines 343-348)

**Issue**: Spec defines performance targets (FCP <1.5s, LCP <2.5s) but doesn't specify network throttling profile for consistent measurement.

**Evidence**:
- Spec line 298: "<1.5s" FCP target (no network condition specified)
- Spec line 359: "3G mobile connection" mentioned in success criteria
- Tasks T025: "Lighthouse audit" but no throttling profile specified

**Impact**: Lighthouse results vary significantly between "No throttling", "Simulated 3G", "Slow 4G". Without baseline, targets are ambiguous.

**Recommendation**: Specify "Lighthouse with Simulated 3G Mobile" as baseline in NFR-002.

**Resolution**: Non-blocking - Tasks T025 will use default Lighthouse settings, can adjust if needed.
