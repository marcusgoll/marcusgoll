# Specification Quality Checklist: Tech Stack CMS Integration (MDX)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: specs/002-tech-stack-cms-integ/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - ✅ Spec describes WHAT (MDX content system), not HOW (implementation details in /plan phase)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
  - ✅ User scenarios describe content creator and reader benefits
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - ✅ Language is accessible, technical terms explained in context
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed
  - ✅ User scenarios, requirements, deployment considerations, quality gates present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3)
  - ✅ Zero clarification markers - all requirements have reasonable defaults
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - ✅ All FR/NFR requirements include specific acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
  - ✅ Performance targets specified (FCP <1.5s, LCP <2.5s, Lighthouse ≥90)
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - ✅ Criteria focus on outcomes (page load times, accessibility) not tools
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - ✅ 5 primary scenarios + 4 edge cases documented
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
  - ✅ Missing frontmatter, invalid MDX, URL preservation, image resolution covered
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded
  - ✅ MVP (US1-US3) vs enhancements (US4-US5) vs nice-to-have (US6-US7) clearly defined
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - ✅ Ghost CMS transition, content migration script, feature flag strategy documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - ✅ 15 FR requirements with specific MUST conditions
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows
  - ✅ Content creation, URL preservation, component embedding, filtering covered
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - ✅ Hypothesis predicts -50% build time reduction; NFR targets performance metrics
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification
  - ✅ Tools/libraries mentioned only in Deployment Considerations (appropriate context)

## Notes

All checklist items passed. Specification is complete and ready for `/plan` phase.

**Rationale for informed guesses** (no clarifications needed):
- Content directory location: `content/posts/` (standard Next.js convention)
- Frontmatter format: YAML (industry standard for Markdown)
- URL structure: `/blog/[slug]` (preserves existing Ghost CMS structure for SEO)
- Migration strategy: Parallel Ghost + MDX during transition (de-risk deployment)
- Rollback: Feature flag + Ghost CMS kept active (standard practice for infrastructure changes)
