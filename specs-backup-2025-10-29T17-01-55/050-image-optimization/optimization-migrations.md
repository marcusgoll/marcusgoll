# Migration Validation

## Migration Check
- migration-plan.md exists: ❌ (expected)
- Database changes: None (frontend-only optimization)

## Assessment
This is a frontend-only feature (Next.js Image optimization). No database migrations expected or required.

### Verification from plan.md
Confirmed from implementation plan:
- **Line 80-82**: "Entities: 0 (no database changes), Relationships: N/A (frontend-only optimization), Migrations required: No"
- **Line 196-197**: "Backend: None (frontend-only optimization)"
- **Line 211-212**: "Database: None"
- **Line 223**: "Migration: No database migrations"
- **Line 233**: "Database Migrations: No"

### Feature Scope
The image optimization feature involves:
- Next.js Image component configuration (next.config.ts)
- Component updates (PostCard, MDXImage, MagazineMasonry, etc.)
- New utility function (shimmer.ts for blur placeholders)
- Performance and accessibility improvements

**No data model changes**
**No API changes**
**No database schema modifications**

## Status
⏭️ SKIPPED - No database changes (expected for image optimization)

## Recommendation
Proceed with optimization phase. No migration planning or execution required.
