## Blockers

**None** - All validation checks passed ✅

## Warnings (Non-Blocking)

1. **Environment Variable Warning**:
   - Issue: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` not set in `.env.local`
   - Impact: Non-blocking (code uses fallback to production URL)
   - Recommendation: Set in production environment to eliminate build warning
   - Priority: Low

## Next Steps

✅ Feature is **APPROVED FOR DEPLOYMENT**

Continue with deployment workflow:
```bash
/ship
```

This will execute:
1. `/preview` - Manual UI/UX testing (pre-flight validation)
2. `/ship-staging` - Deploy to staging environment
3. `/validate-staging` - Manual testing on staging
4. `/ship-prod` - Deploy to production

## Post-Deployment Actions

After production deployment:
1. Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
2. Submit sitemap to Bing Webmaster Tools
3. Verify accessibility at https://marcusgoll.com/sitemap.xml
4. Monitor Google Search Console for indexing status (1-3 days)
