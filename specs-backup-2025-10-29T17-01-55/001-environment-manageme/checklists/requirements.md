# Specification Quality Checklist: Environment Management (.env)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: specs/001-environment-manageme/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Spec focuses on what, not how
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs - Developer experience and security focused
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders - Clear user scenarios and acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed - All required template sections present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3) - Zero clarifications needed
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous - All FR/NFR items have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable - User stories have specific, testable acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic - Success defined by outcomes, not implementation
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined - 4 primary scenarios + 4 edge cases documented
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified - Missing vars, invalid formats, secret rotation covered
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded - Out of scope section explicitly lists non-goals
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified - 5 assumptions and security considerations documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 12 FR items with testable criteria
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows - 7 user stories prioritized P1-P3
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - MVP strategy defined
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification - Spec focuses on configuration needs, not code

## Deployment Readiness

- [x] CHK017 - Environment variables documented - 12 variables documented with dev/prod values
- [x] CHK018 - Breaking changes identified - None (new feature)
- [x] CHK019 - Rollback plan specified - 3-command rollback documented
- [x] CHK020 - Security considerations documented - 5 security items including git audit

## Notes

**Status**: âœ… ALL CHECKS PASSED

**Summary**: Specification is complete, clear, and ready for planning phase. No clarifications needed.

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive environment variable documentation (12 variables across 4 categories)
- Clear MVP strategy with 7 prioritized user stories
- Strong security focus (5 security considerations)
- Well-defined deployment considerations
- Explicit out-of-scope items prevent scope creep

**Recommendations**:
- Proceed directly to `/plan` phase
- No `/clarify` needed (zero ambiguities)
