## Detailed Analysis

### Constitution Alignment

Checked alignment with constitution.md principles:

- Specification First: Spec created and reviewed
- Testing Standards: Component tests (T007), E2E tests (T008), A11y tests (T009) planned
- Performance Requirements: NFR-002 defines <100ms toggle response, <5KB bundle increase
- Accessibility: NFR-001 targets WCAG 2.1 AA, keyboard/screen reader support
- Security Practices: No security concerns (client-side only, no user input)
- Code Quality: TypeScript strict mode, follows shadcn/ui patterns
- Documentation Standards: T010 documents implementation summary

All constitution principles addressed.

### Cross-Artifact Consistency

**Spec to Plan Alignment**:
- spec.md FR-001 (ThemeToggle component) → plan.md [NEW INFRASTRUCTURE - CREATE] ThemeToggle component
- spec.md FR-002 (Desktop integration) → plan.md [HEADER MODIFICATIONS] Desktop nav
- spec.md FR-003 (Mobile integration) → plan.md [HEADER MODIFICATIONS] Mobile menu
- spec.md FR-004 (Smooth transitions) → plan.md [PERFORMANCE TARGETS] CSS transitions
- spec.md FR-005 (Icon selection) → plan.md lucide-react Sun/Moon icons
- spec.md FR-006 (Persistence) → plan.md next-themes localStorage

All functional requirements mapped to plan architecture.

**Plan to Tasks Alignment**:
- plan.md ThemeToggle component → T002, T003, T004
- plan.md Desktop integration → T005
- plan.md Mobile integration → T006
- plan.md Testing strategy → T007, T008, T009
- plan.md Documentation → T010

All plan components mapped to tasks.

**User Story Coverage**:
- US-001 (Manual toggle) → T002, T005, T006 (component + integrations)
- US-002 (System preference) → T002 (useTheme hook respects system)
- US-003 (Keyboard accessibility) → T003 (ARIA + keyboard)
- US-004 (Screen reader) → T003 (ARIA labels)
- US-005 (Mobile toggle) → T006 (mobile menu integration)

All user stories covered by tasks.

### Requirement Coverage

| Requirement | Tasks | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| FR-001: ThemeToggle component | T002, T003, T004 | Covered |
| FR-002: Desktop integration | T005 | Covered |
| FR-003: Mobile integration | T006 | Covered |
| FR-004: Smooth transitions | T004 (CSS) | Covered |
| FR-005: Icon selection | T002 (Sun/Moon) | Covered |
| FR-006: Persistence | T002 (next-themes) | Covered |
| NFR-001: Accessibility | T003, T009 | Covered |
| NFR-002: Performance | T004, implicit in implementation | Covered |
| NFR-003: Browser compatibility | Implicit (Next.js 15) | Covered |
| NFR-004: Code quality | T007, T010 | Covered |
| US-001: Manual toggle | T002, T005, T006 | Covered |
| US-002: System preference | T002 | Covered |
| US-003: Keyboard accessibility | T003, T009 | Covered |
| US-004: Screen reader | T003, T009 | Covered |
| US-005: Mobile toggle | T006 | Covered |

**Coverage Score**: 15/15 requirements = 100%

### Dependency Validation

**Existing Dependencies** (plan.md [EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE - REUSE]):
- next-themes 0.4.6 - Validated in package.json
- lucide-react 0.546.0 - Validated in package.json
- Button component - Validated exists at components/ui/Button.tsx
- cn utility - Validated exists at lib/utils.ts
- CSS variables - Validated in app/globals.css

**New Dependencies**: None required

**Bundle Impact**: Estimated ~1KB for ThemeToggle component (within NFR-002 <5KB limit)

### Task Sequencing

Phase 1 (Setup):
- T001 - Validate structure (blocking all)

Phase 2 (Component Creation):
- T002 → T003 → T004 (sequential, same file)

Phase 3 (Integration):
- T005, T006 (parallel, different sections of Header.tsx)
- Depends on: T004 complete

Phase 4 (Testing):
- T007, T008, T009 (fully parallel, different test files)
- Depends on: T006 complete

Phase 5 (Documentation):
- T010 (after all tests pass)

**Dependency Graph**: Valid, no circular dependencies

### Constitution Compliance

Checked against `.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md` MUST principles:

1. **Specification First**: Spec created before implementation
2. **Testing Standards**: 3 test tasks (T007, T008, T009) for 100% coverage
3. **Performance Requirements**: NFR-002 defines metrics (<100ms, <5KB)
4. **Accessibility**: NFR-001 targets WCAG 2.1 AA
5. **Security Practices**: N/A (client-side only, no user input)
6. **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, shadcn/ui patterns
7. **Documentation Standards**: T010 updates NOTES.md
8. **Do Not Overengineer**: Uses existing next-themes, no custom theme system

All constitution principles followed.

### Ambiguity Check

Reviewed spec.md for vague terms:

- "Smooth transitions" → Quantified in FR-004 (200-300ms CSS transitions)
- "Toggle response time" → Quantified in NFR-002 (<100ms)
- "Accessible" → Quantified in NFR-001 (WCAG 2.1 AA, keyboard, screen reader)
- "Performance" → Quantified in NFR-002 (<5KB bundle, no CLS)

No ambiguous requirements found.

### Terminology Consistency

Key terms across artifacts:

| Term | spec.md | plan.md | tasks.md | Consistent? |
|------|---------|---------|----------|-------------|
| ThemeToggle | FR-001 | [NEW INFRASTRUCTURE] | T002 | Yes |
| next-themes | FR-001 | [ARCHITECTURE] | T002 | Yes |
| lucide-react | FR-005 | [EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE] | T002 | Yes |
| Sun/Moon icons | FR-005 | [NEW INFRASTRUCTURE] | T002 | Yes |
| ARIA labels | FR-001 | [ACCESSIBILITY] | T003 | Yes |
| Ghost variant | FR-002 | [NEW INFRASTRUCTURE] | T004 | Yes |

All terminology consistent across artifacts.

## Next Actions

**Ready for Implementation**

Next: `/implement`

/implement will:
1. Execute tasks from tasks.md (10 tasks)
2. Create ThemeToggle component
3. Integrate into Header (desktop + mobile)
4. Write component tests, E2E tests, accessibility tests
5. Update NOTES.md with implementation summary

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours

**Pre-Implementation Checklist**:
- Validate next-themes, lucide-react installed
- Verify Button component exists
- Confirm Header.tsx structure matches plan assumptions
- Review CSS variables in globals.css
