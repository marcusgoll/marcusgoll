## Findings

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| C1 | Coverage | MEDIUM | tasks.md | Only 4 of 10 user stories explicitly tagged in tasks ([US6], [US7], [US8], [US10]). US1-US5 (MVP) missing explicit tags. | Add [US1] through [US5] tags to relevant tasks for traceability |
| C2 | Consistency | MEDIUM | plan.md:8, tasks.md:7 | Plan identifies 8 components for reuse, tasks show 7 REUSE markers (1 missing) | Verify all 8 reusable components have corresponding REUSE markers in tasks |
| D1 | Documentation | LOW | tasks.md | NFR coverage: 10 of 23 NFRs explicitly referenced. Performance/security NFRs implicit in validation tasks. | Consider adding NFR references to validation tasks (T027, T032) for clarity |
| D2 | Documentation | LOW | NOTES.md | No existing NOTES.md checkpoint content (file exists but empty beyond Phase 2 summary) | Populate NOTES.md during implementation with migration observations |
| D3 | Documentation | LOW | spec.md vs tasks.md | Spec mentions staging (US10) as future, tasks include T038 for staging documentation but unclear priority | Clarify T038-T039 are informational only (not implemented in MVP) |

## Cross-Artifact Consistency Analysis

### Requirement → Plan → Task Mapping

**Functional Requirements (FR-001 through FR-030)**:
✅ All 30 functional requirements traced to plan architecture decisions
✅ All requirements covered by implementation tasks
✅ No orphaned requirements (requirements without tasks)
✅ No orphaned tasks (tasks without requirement basis)

**Sample Traceability** (verified):
- FR-001 (Dokploy installation without disruption) → plan.md Zero-Downtime Migration → T005 (installation), T003 (prerequisites)
- FR-006 (GitHub webhook) → plan.md GitHub webhook configuration → T020 (webhook setup), T021 (test)
- FR-023 through FR-026 (rollback) → plan.md Rollback Plan → T030 (rollback testing)

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR-001 through NFR-023)**:
✅ Performance NFRs (NFR-001 through NFR-004) → plan.md [PERFORMANCE TARGETS] → tasks.md validation tasks
✅ Security NFRs (NFR-005 through NFR-008) → plan.md [SECURITY] → T007 (SSL), T008 (admin access), T012 (secrets)
✅ Reliability NFRs (NFR-009 through NFR-012) → plan.md [DEPLOYMENT ACCEPTANCE] → T028 (health checks), T030 (rollback)
✅ Resource NFRs (NFR-021 through NFR-023) → plan.md resource constraints → T032 (monitoring)

**Finding**: 10 of 23 NFRs have explicit task references. Remaining 13 are implicitly validated through acceptance criteria (e.g., NFR-001 "UI response <2s" tested in T015, T027). Not a blocker but could improve traceability.

### User Story Coverage

**User Stories Declared** (spec.md): US1-US10

**User Stories Explicitly Tagged** (tasks.md): US6, US7, US8, US10 (4 of 10)

**Coverage Analysis**:
- US1 (Dokploy installation): Covered by T005-T008 (missing [US1] tag)
- US2 (Application migration): Covered by T009-T015, T019-T022 (missing [US2] tag)
- US3 (Environment variables): Covered by T012 (missing [US3] tag)
- US4 (Database management): Covered by T016-T018 (missing [US4] tag)
- US5 (Rollback capability): Covered by T030 (missing [US5] tag)
- US6 (Deployment notifications): Covered by T023 [US6] ✓
- US7 (Monitoring dashboard): Covered by T029 [US7] ✓
- US8 (Config export): Covered by T031 [US8] ✓
- US9 (Health checks): Covered by T028 (missing [US9] tag)
- US10 (Staging docs): Covered by T038 [US10] ✓

**Finding**: All user stories have task coverage. Issue is tagging inconsistency (MVP stories US1-US5 lack tags, enhancement stories US6-US10 have tags). Recommend adding tags for consistency but not a blocker.

### Architecture → Implementation Alignment

**Architecture Patterns** (plan.md):
1. Zero-Downtime Migration (Blue-Green) → Tasks Phase 1-3 (parallel setup)
2. Configuration as Code → T031 (CLI export)
3. Incremental Validation → T013-T015 (test subdomain)
4. Environment Variable Migration → T012

**Deployment Strategy**:
- Plan: "Blue-Green deployment at infrastructure level"
- Tasks: Phase 1 (backup), Phase 2 (install parallel), Phase 3 (test subdomain), Phase 6 (cutover)
- ✅ Aligned: Migration strategy correctly decomposed into tasks

**Component Reuse** (plan.md [EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE - REUSE]):
Plan identifies 8 components:
1. Dockerfile (D:\Coding\marcusgoll\Dockerfile) → T011 REUSE ✓
2. docker-compose.prod.yml → T002 REUSE ✓
3. deploy.sh logic → T002 REUSE ✓
4. GitHub Actions CI → T022 REUSE ✓
5. Caddy reverse proxy → T006 REUSE ✓
6. Let's Encrypt SSL → T007 REUSE ✓
7. Health check endpoint (/api/health) → T028 REUSE ✓
8. Environment variable schema → T012 REUSE (reference but not explicit REUSE marker)

**Finding**: 7 of 8 components have explicit REUSE markers. T012 references schema but lacks REUSE marker. Minor consistency issue.

### Breaking Change Detection

**Spec Declaration** (spec.md:387-398):
- "No Breaking Changes"
- Deployment platform change only (internal)
- Application code unchanged
- API contracts unchanged
- Database schema unchanged
- User-facing site unchanged

**Plan Validation** (plan.md [CI/CD IMPACT]):
- "No Breaking Changes" confirmed
- "Internal-Only Changes" listed
- Client compatibility: N/A

**Tasks Verification**:
- No database migration tasks
- No API contract update tasks
- No schema change tasks
- No client-side code modification tasks

**Conclusion**: ✅ No breaking changes confirmed. Infrastructure migration only.

- T016: Database connection security (connection string not exposed per NFR-008)

**Assessment**: ✅ Security requirements adequately addressed in tasks.

---

## Anti-Duplication Verification

**Reuse Markers Found** (tasks.md):
1. T002: REUSE D:\Coding\marcusgoll\docker-compose.prod.yml, deploy.sh
2. T007: REUSE Certbot SSL provisioning pattern
3. T011: REUSE D:\Coding\marcusgoll\Dockerfile
4. T012: REUSE Environment variable schema from deploy-production.yml:32-37
5. T022: REUSE .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml:1-55 structure
6. T028: REUSE /api/health endpoint
7. T006: REUSE Caddyfile marcusgoll.com configuration pattern

**New Components Created** (plan.md [NEW INFRASTRUCTURE - CREATE]):
1. Dokploy Docker container → T005
2. Dokploy application configuration → T009-T014
3. Dokploy database import → T016-T018
4. Caddy subdomain config → T006
5. GitHub webhook → T019-T021
6. Dokploy CLI export → T031

**Assessment**: ✅ Clear delineation between reused and new components. No duplicate work identified.

**Minor Issue**: Plan identifies 8 reusable components, tasks show 7 REUSE markers. T012 references env var schema but lacks explicit REUSE marker (minor documentation inconsistency).

---

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks (Blockers)

**None identified**. All critical success factors met:
- ✅ VPS snapshot strategy (full rollback capability)
- ✅ Zero-downtime migration (blue-green pattern)
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (test subdomain before production)
- ✅ Rollback testing (T030 validates recovery)

### High Risks (Should Address)

**None identified**.

### Medium Risks (Monitor During Implementation)

**Risk 1**: User story tagging inconsistency
- **Impact**: Reduced traceability during implementation
- **Mitigation**: Add [US1] through [US5] tags to relevant tasks
- **Priority**: Medium (documentation clarity)

**Risk 2**: REUSE marker inconsistency
- **Impact**: Minor (one component missing explicit marker)
- **Mitigation**: Add REUSE marker to T012 for environment variable schema
- **Priority**: Low (does not block implementation)

### Low Risks (Acceptable)

**Risk 3**: NFR traceability gaps
- **Impact**: 13 of 23 NFRs lack explicit task references
- **Mitigation**: Implicit validation via acceptance criteria sufficient
- **Priority**: Low (nice-to-have for documentation)

**Risk 4**: Staging documentation ambiguity
- **Impact**: Unclear whether T038-T039 are MVP or future
- **Mitigation**: tasks.md Phase 8 header says "Deferred", clarify in implementation
- **Priority**: Low (clearly marked as future scope)

## Performance & Resource Validation

### Performance Targets (from spec.md, plan.md)

**Deployment Performance**:
- Target: <7 minutes (NFR-002)
- Validation: T014 (first deployment), T021 (webhook deployment)
- Measurement: Dokploy deployment logs

**Site Performance**:
- Target: No regression (Lighthouse ≥85, FCP <1.5s, LCP <2.5s)
- Validation: T015 (test subdomain Lighthouse), T027 (production Lighthouse)
- Baseline: Pre-migration Lighthouse audit (should be documented)

**Dokploy UI Performance**:
- Target: <2 seconds response time (NFR-001)
- Validation: T008 (dashboard load), T015 (UI interactions)

**Assessment**: ✅ Performance targets clearly defined with validation tasks.

### Resource Constraints

**Dokploy Overhead Targets** (NFR-021, NFR-022, NFR-023):
- RAM: <500MB
- CPU: <10% idle
- Disk: <5GB

**Validation**: T032 (24-hour monitoring), T036 (success metrics baseline)

**VPS Capacity**:
- Current: 4-8GB RAM (per plan.md, spec.md)
- Dokploy: ~500MB overhead
- Headroom: 3.5-7.5GB (70-90% available for application)

**Assessment**: ✅ Sufficient VPS capacity. Resource monitoring included in validation tasks.

## Recommendations

### Before Implementation (Priority: High)

1. **Add User Story Tags to MVP Tasks**
   - Add [US1] to T005-T008 (Dokploy installation)
   - Add [US2] to T009-T015, T019-T022 (Application migration)
   - Add [US3] to T012 (Environment variables)
   - Add [US4] to T016-T018 (Database management)
   - Add [US5] to T030 (Rollback capability)
   - **Why**: Improves traceability and ensures all acceptance criteria validated

2. **Add Missing REUSE Marker**
   - Add explicit REUSE marker to T012 for environment variable schema
   - **Why**: Consistency with other reuse markers, prevents duplicate work

### During Implementation (Priority: Medium)

3. **Populate NOTES.md Progressively**
   - Document VPS prerequisites output (T003)
   - Record admin credentials location securely (T005)
   - Log migration observations (Phase 3-6)
   - Capture baseline metrics (T036)
   - **Why**: Audit trail and troubleshooting reference

4. **Clarify NFR Validation**
   - Add NFR references to validation tasks where applicable
   - Example: T027 add "(validates NFR-003 site performance)"
   - **Why**: Explicit traceability for quality gates

### Post-Implementation (Priority: Low)

5. **Archive Migration Documentation**
   - After 7-day validation period, archive pre-migration configs
   - Document final migration duration and metrics in NOTES.md
   - **Why**: Knowledge preservation for future migrations
