## [DEPENDENCY GRAPH]
Migration phase order:
1. Phase 1: Pre-Migration Setup (blocks all phases)
2. Phase 2: Dokploy Installation (depends on Phase 1)
3. Phase 3: Application Migration (depends on Phase 2)
4. Phase 4: Database Integration (depends on Phase 3, parallel with Phase 5)
5. Phase 5: CI/CD Integration (depends on Phase 3, parallel with Phase 4)
6. Phase 6: Production Cutover (depends on Phase 3, 4, 5)
7. Phase 7: Post-Migration Validation (depends on Phase 6)

## [PARALLEL EXECUTION OPPORTUNITIES]
- Phase 1: T001, T002, T003 (different VPS checks, no dependencies)
- Phase 4 & 5: Can run in parallel after Phase 3 complete
- Phase 7: T035, T036, T037 (different validation tests)

## [IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY]
**Migration Approach**: Blue-Green infrastructure deployment
**Testing Strategy**: Subdomain validation before production cutover
**Rollback Strategy**: VPS snapshot + Caddy config revert (<15 min)
**No TDD Required**: Infrastructure migration, validation via integration tests
