# Brand-Consistent Content Creation

## Overview

This skill helps you create content for marcusgoll.com that maintains brand consistency across two parallel content tracks (Aviation and Dev/Startup) while reinforcing Marcus's core positioning as someone who teaches systematic thinking from 30,000 feet.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing blog posts for marcusgoll.com
- Creating content for Aviation or Dev/Startup tracks
- Drafting articles that cross-pollinate between both domains
- Ensuring brand voice consistency across content types

## Core Brand Principles

### Dual-Track Positioning

Marcus serves two distinct but complementary audiences:

**Aviation Track**:
- Student pilots and aspiring pilots
- Certified Flight Instructors (CFIs)
- Aviation professionals seeking career guidance

**Dev/Startup Track**:
- Developers building side hustles while working full-time
- Junior/mid-level developers learning systematic practices
- Aspiring founders and #BuildInPublic community

### Brand Voice Fundamentals

**Tone**:
- Professional but approachable (not corporate)
- Teacher's voice (explaining, not preaching)
- Systematic and methodical (aviation precision)
- Transparent and authentic (building in public mindset)

**Avoid**:
- Jargon without explanation
- Overly casual or unprofessional language
- Making definitive claims without experience backing
- Talking down to readers

### Key Messaging Framework

Every piece of content should reinforce at least one of these core messages:

1. **Systematic Thinking Works Everywhere**: Aviation's disciplined approach makes you better at development, teaching, and business
2. **You Don't Have to Choose One Passion**: Build a career that honors all your interests
3. **Teaching is the Ultimate Skill**: Clear explanations come from deep understanding
4. **Build While You Work**: You don't need to quit to build a startup
5. **Share the Journey**: Building in public creates accountability and helps others

## Content Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Content Track

Determine which track this content belongs to:

- **Aviation**: Flight training, CFI resources, aviation career topics
- **Dev/Startup**: Building CFIPros.com, systematic development, tutorials
- **Cross-Pollination**: Aviation principles applied to coding (highest value!)

### Step 2: Define Target Audience

Be specific about who you're writing for:

**Aviation**:
- Student pilots (0-500 hours, studying for certificates)
- CFIs (teaching instructors, building hours)
- Career changers (entering aviation industry)

**Dev/Startup**:
- Side hustle builders (full-time job + startup)
- Junior/mid devs (0-5 years experience)
- Multi-passionate professionals

### Step 3: Structure Your Content

Use this proven blog post structure:

```markdown
# [Compelling Title with Target Keyword]

[Hook paragraph - personal anecdote or provocative question]

## Introduction (Why This Matters)
- State the problem clearly
- Show you understand their pain point
- Preview what they'll learn

## [Main Content Sections]
- Break into 3-5 logical sections
- Use H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections
- Include examples from YOUR experience (aviation or coding)
- Add code snippets, checklists, or visuals where helpful

## Practical Takeaways
- Bulleted action items
- Concrete next steps
- Resources or tools mentioned

## Conclusion
- Summarize key insight
- Connect back to systematic thinking theme
- Clear CTA (comment, share, try something)
```

### Step 4: Apply Brand Voice

**For Aviation Content**:
- Reference your CFI experience ("When I was teaching students...")
- Use aviation analogies sparingly (readers know aviation)
- Focus on teaching methods from 10 years of education background
- Share specific lessons learned from flight instruction

**For Dev/Startup Content**:
- Reference building CFIPros.com specifically
- Show the "building while flying full-time" reality (time constraints, trade-offs)
- Apply aviation checklists/systematic approach to dev workflows
- Be transparent about failures and pivots

**For Cross-Pollination Content** (highest engagement):
- Start with aviation principle (checklists, pre-flight procedures, safety culture)
- Show how it applies to development (code review, deployment procedures, error handling)
- Provide both aviation AND development examples
- These posts appeal to BOTH audiences

### Step 5: Generate Post Metadata

Every post needs:

```yaml
---
title: [SEO-optimized title, 50-60 characters]
date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
track: [aviation | dev-startup | cross-pollination]
category: [flight-training | cfi-resources | building-in-public | tutorials | etc.]
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3, tag4, tag5]
description: [Meta description, 150-160 characters, includes keyword]
reading_time: [X min]
featured_image: [/images/post-slug.jpg]
---
```

Use the `generate-frontmatter.sh` script to create consistent metadata.

### Step 6: Add Track Badge

Include track identifier at top of post:

```html
<div class="post-header">
  <span class="badge badge-aviation">Aviation</span>
  <!-- OR -->
  <span class="badge badge-dev">Dev/Startup</span>
  <!-- OR -->
  <span class="badge badge-cross">Cross-Pollination</span>

  <h1>[Post Title]</h1>
  <div class="post-meta">
    <span class="date">[Date]</span>
    <span class="read-time">[X] min read</span>
  </div>
</div>
```
