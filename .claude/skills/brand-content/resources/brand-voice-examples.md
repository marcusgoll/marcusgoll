# Brand Voice Examples

Examples of Marcus Gollahon's brand voice across different content tracks.

## Aviation Track Voice

### Example 1: Flight Training Post

**Good**:
```
When I was teaching students how to land in crosswinds, I noticed a pattern.
Most struggled not because they lacked skill, but because they were trying
to remember 12 different steps at once.

So I broke it down into a 3-step checklist:
1. Align with centerline using rudder
2. Prevent drift with opposite aileron
3. Touch down on upwind wheel first

Within two lessons, my students were consistently nailing crosswind landings.
```

**Why it works**:
- Personal teaching experience ("When I was teaching...")
- Specific problem identified ("12 different steps")
- Systematic solution (3-step checklist)
- Measurable result ("within two lessons")

**Avoid**:
```
Crosswind landings are challenging. Here are some tips that might help.
```
- Too generic, no personal experience
- Vague language ("might help")
- No systematic approach

### Example 2: Aviation Career Post

**Good**:
```
The jump from flight instructor to airline pilot took me longer than expected.
Not because of hours—I had the 1500 needed. But because I didn't understand
the interview process.

Here's what I wish someone told me: Airlines don't just want hours. They want
systematic thinking, crew resource management skills, and professionalism.

I spent 3 months preparing for PSA's interview. Practiced CRM scenarios,
studied the company culture, rehearsed my "tell me about yourself" answer
30 times. When the interview came, I was ready.

Got the job offer 5 days later.
```

**Why it works**:
- Honest about struggles ("took me longer than expected")
- Shares specific insight (CRM skills matter more than hours)
- Concrete preparation steps (3 months, 30 practice runs)
- Real outcome (job offer in 5 days)

## Dev/Startup Track Voice

### Example 1: Building in Public Post

**Good**:
```
CFIPros.com revenue: $0
Users: 23 (20 are probably bots)
Time invested: 47 hours this month

This is Month 3 of building in public, and it's humbling. I thought by now
I'd have 100+ real users and at least a few paying CFIs. Reality check:
building a marketplace is hard.

But here's what I learned this month that's actually working:
- Cold DMs to CFIs get 40% response rate (vs 5% from Twitter posts)
- Flight schools are more interested than individual CFIs
- My "systematic flight training" positioning resonates

Next month: Pivot to flight schools. Build a demo for 5 schools in Texas.
```

**Why it works**:
- Transparent metrics (even when bad)
- Honest about expectations vs reality
- Systematic analysis (what's working, what's not)
- Clear next action (pivot decision)

**Avoid**:
```
Things are going great with CFIPros! Lots of interest. Stay tuned!
```
- Too vague, no metrics
- No vulnerability (not authentic)
- No actionable insight

### Example 2: Systematic Development Post

**Good**:
```
Deploying code to production used to terrify me. One typo in the database
migration and boom—user data at risk.

Then I remembered pre-flight checklists. Before every flight, I check:
- Fuel levels
- Control surfaces
- Emergency equipment
- Weather conditions

Never skip steps. Never rush. Lives depend on it.

So I built a pre-deployment checklist for code:
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Staging environment validated
- [ ] Database backup created
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

Haven't had a production incident in 6 months. Checklists work.
```

**Why it works**:
- Personal vulnerability ("terrified me")
- Clear aviation → dev connection (pre-flight → pre-deployment)
- Specific parallel (both protect against catastrophic failure)
- Measurable result (6 months incident-free)

## Cross-Pollination Voice (HIGHEST VALUE)

### Example: "Code Review Like a Flight Instructor"

**Good**:
```
As a CFI, my job wasn't to point out what students did wrong. It was to help
them develop systematic thinking so they wouldn't make the same mistake twice.

Bad flight instructors say: "You're too high on final approach."
Good flight instructors ask: "What airspeed and altitude should we have at
this point? How does our current state compare?"

The student figures it out themselves. That's when learning happens.

Code review works the same way.

Bad code review:
"This function is too long. Refactor it."

Good code review:
"I'm noticing this function handles 4 different responsibilities. What would
single responsibility principle suggest here?"

When reviewers ask questions instead of giving answers, developers learn to
think systematically. They don't just fix one function—they develop an eye
for code quality.

I use this approach on every PR review now. The junior devs on my team have
started catching their own code smells before I even look at the PR.

That's the systematic thinking mindset in action.
```

**Why it works**:
- Clear parallel between CFI teaching and code review
- Specific before/after examples (bad vs good)
- Systematic principle (questions > answers)
- Measurable impact (juniors self-reviewing better)
- Appeals to BOTH aviation and dev audiences

## Tone Guidelines by Track

### Aviation Track
- **Authoritative**: You have 2 years CFI experience, 10 years teaching
- **Practical**: Flight training is expensive—give actionable value
- **Safety-focused**: Aviation culture prioritizes safety, show that
- **Teaching-focused**: Leverage your educator background

### Dev/Startup Track
- **Transparent**: Share real metrics, failures, pivots
- **Systematic**: Apply aviation's methodical approach
- **Time-conscious**: Acknowledge building while working full-time
- **Community-oriented**: #BuildInPublic = sharing journey

### Cross-Pollination
- **Insightful**: Connect domains in unexpected ways
- **Specific**: Don't just say "systematic"—show HOW
- **Dual-audience**: Write so both aviators and devs get value
- **Authentic**: Only draw parallels from real experience

## Writing Red Flags

**STOP if you find yourself writing**:

1. ❌ "As a thought leader..." (too self-important)
2. ❌ "In my opinion..." (state experience, not opinions)
3. ❌ "You should..." (too prescriptive, suggest instead)
4. ❌ Generic advice without personal experience
5. ❌ Jargon without explanation
6. ❌ Claims without evidence or examples

**INSTEAD, write**:

1. ✅ "When teaching students, I found..."
2. ✅ "Here's what worked for me..."
3. ✅ "Consider trying..."
4. ✅ Specific stories from flight deck or codebase
5. ✅ Define terms or skip jargon entirely
6. ✅ Every claim backed by experience or data

**Use these examples as templates, but always draw from YOUR authentic experiences. The brand voice works because it's genuinely you—pilot, teacher, developer, builder.**
