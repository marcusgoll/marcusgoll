In aviation, we handle [similar problem] with [systematic approach].

**Example**: [Specific aviation scenario]

[Describe how aviation handles it systematically]

**Why it works**: [Safety culture, checklists, whatever principle applies]

## Applying This to Development

The same principle applies to [development scenario]:

### The Aviation Approach
1. [Step 1 from aviation]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

### The Development Equivalent
1. [Translated step 1 for code]
2. [Translated step 2]

## Real Example from CFIPros.com

When building [specific feature], I applied this approach:

[Walk through specific code example]

```markdown
---
title: [Aviation Concept] for [Dev Audience] | [Dev Concept] for [Aviation Audience]
track: cross-pollination

# [Compelling Title That Appeals to Both Audiences]

[Hook that grabs both aviation people and developers]

## The Aviation Perspective

[Explain aviation concept/problem clearly for developers who may not know aviation]

**Example scenario**: [Specific aviation situation]

## The Development Perspective

[Explain parallel dev concept/problem clearly for pilots who may not be developers]

**Example scenario**: [Specific coding situation]

## The Systematic Principle (Core Insight)

Both domains solve this with the same underlying principle: **[Principle name]**

**In aviation**: [How it manifests]

**In development**: [How it manifests]

**Why it works in both**: [Deep insight about systematic thinking]

## How to Apply This

**For pilots learning to code**:
1. [Specific step]
2. [Another step]

**For developers interested in aviation**:
1. [Specific step]
2. [Another step]

**For anyone building systems**:
1. [Universal principle]
2. [Universal application]

## My Experience Using This

[Personal story applying this in BOTH domains]
