---

## v2.0.0 - 2025-10-21

**Type**: MAJOR

**Changes**: Personalized constitution for Marcus Gollahon's personal website/blog project. Added comprehensive Personal Brand Principles section integrating aviation, education, dev projects, and startup content strategy.

**What Changed**:

1. **Title & Purpose**:
   - Changed from generic "Engineering Constitution" to "Marcus Gollahon - Engineering & Brand Constitution"
   - Added project context: Personal Website/Blog - Aviation, Education, Dev Projects, Startups
   - Expanded purpose to include brand standards alongside engineering standards

2. **Brand Mission & Essence**:
   - Added brand mission statement
   - Defined brand essence: "Systematic Mastery"

3. **New Section: Personal Brand Principles** (6 principles added):
   - **Systematic Clarity**: Aviation checklists inspire UI/UX, teaching drives content structure
   - **Visual Brand Consistency**: Navy/Emerald color palette, Work Sans typography, 8px spacing
   - **Multi-Passionate Integration**: 40% aviation, 40% dev, 20% cross-pollination content mix
   - **Authentic Building in Public**: Transparent sharing of wins/failures from CFIPros.com
   - **Teaching-First Content**: Leverage 10 years teaching experience for educational content
   - **Documentation Standards for Brand Assets**: Maintain brand docs in `/docs/` folder

4. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Added "Brand vs Engineering" priority framework
   - Added "Brand vs Brand" priority framework
   - Examples: Brand consistency > feature velocity, teaching quality > content quantity

5. **References**:
   - Added "Brand & Content Strategy" section linking to:
     - `docs/MARCUS_BRAND_PROFILE.md`
     - `docs/VISUAL_BRAND_GUIDE.md`
     - `docs/BRAND_STRATEGY_FRAMEWORK.md`
     - `docs/COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md`
     - And other brand/content docs
   - Added "Project Documentation" section

6. **Metadata Updates**:
   - Updated maintainer: "Marcus Gollahon + Claude Code"
   - Added project context footer

**Template Impact**:
- Templates should now reference both engineering AND brand principles
- Spec templates should include brand consistency validation
- Design/UI specs should reference `VISUAL_BRAND_GUIDE.md`
- Content specs should reference `MARCUS_BRAND_PROFILE.md`

**Rationale**:
This is a MAJOR version bump because the constitution now serves dual purposes (engineering + brand) and fundamentally changes how features/content are validated. The addition of brand principles creates new mandatory requirements that didn't exist before, making this a breaking change for the workflow.

**Integration Points**:
- `/spec` command should validate against brand principles
- `/plan` command should consider content strategy (40/40/20 mix)
- `/optimize` command should validate visual brand consistency
- All feature work should reference relevant brand docs
